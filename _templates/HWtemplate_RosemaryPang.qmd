# Question 1

## a

First, let's read in the data from the Excel file:

```{r, echo=T}
library(readxl)
df <- read_excel("_data/LungCapData.xls")
```


The distribution of LungCap looks as follows:

```{r, echo=T}
hist(df$LungCap)
```

The histogram suggests that the distribution is close to a normal distribution. Most of the observations are close to the mean. Very few observations are close to the margins (0 and 15).
