## DACSS 603, spring 2023

## Final Project check-in 2, Diana Rinker.

# Introduction. Online engagement

It is well known that online engagement and popularity with the web
resource is a highly valuable metric and is driving site revenue. This
research project is exploring which factors contribute to users online
engagement.

To do that I will use the data of an online blog on the news website.
The author of this blog is posting articles about interpersonal
relationships every work day (Mon- Fri). The posts are formulated as a
letter from a reader with the situation and a question about
relationships. The author gives an advice about the situation. Website
readers are free to comment under each post, but cannot make their own
posts.

All post methadata and comments are public. They are saved by the
website and available for the analysis. Using this data set, I will
explore how readers' engagement connected with blogs's author
engagement, site comments', web source of readers and negative behaviors
online.

My research question is: Does the authors engagement in the conversation
around the post makes readers more engaged and promotes positive
interactions among them?

**DV:** My dependent construct is **"user's engagement**", I will
measure users' engagement at the level of individual post, using the
following metrics:

1.  Page views
2.  Page visits (one visit can contain a few views, if the person visits
    other pages on the site)
3.  Unique users. One person can visit the same page a few times (it is
    calculated for all time since the page was posted).
4.  Number of votes: "thums up" or "thumbs down"
5.  Number of comments
6.  Exit rate or "bounces". When the visitor is coming to the page and
    then leaving, i.e. not opening other pages on this website.

L2 - page readers \* Reveal letter \* Reveal comments

**IV:** My main independent variable is **Blog's author engagement.** I
will measure authors engagement as the factor variable, with the
following levels:

A. Unspecified comment

B. Featured comment

C. Engagement in conversation

To control for **confounders,** I will also measure the follwing
variables:

1.  Topic of the post ("post tag"), categorical variable.

2.  Source of the readers, also categorical variable.

3.  Mood of the conversation , derivative continuous variable calculated
    as the ratio of "likes" to "dislikes".

4.  Blocked and flagged comments.

```{r, echo=F}
#Loading necessary libraries: 
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Data source and description. 

To answer my research question I will use two datasets. the first data
set has information about all comments associated with each post by post
ID. The second data set is analytics data for the web bage. It contains
one post per row and variables describe each post as a whole without
breaking down to the comment level.

In this project I will analyze posts for January 2021 - February 2023.
Here is the list of variables in each dataset: 
Post-level data:
```{r, echo=T}
getwd()
# First, I will load the data set with the comment level data:
raw <- as_tibble (read_csv("C:\\Users\\Diana\\OneDrive - University Of Massachusetts Medical School\\Documents\\R\\R working directory\\DACSS\\603\\my study files for dacss603\\globe\\ data.2021.plus.csv"))
comments.data<-raw 
colnames (comments.data)
head(comments.data$written_at)
comments.data <-comments.data%>%
              mutate(com.year = format(written_at,format = "%Y" ))
# range(comments.data$com.year)
# dim(comments.data)
str(comments.data)
```
Comment data: 
```{r, echo=T}
# Second, loadng post-level data :
merged <- as_tibble (read_csv("C:\\Users\\Diana\\OneDrive - University Of Massachusetts Medical School\\Documents\\R\\R working directory\\DACSS\\603\\my study files for dacss603\\globe\\data.merged.csv"))
# colnames(merged)
str(merged)
```

Be

To begin, I will review available variables and evaluate whether it is a
good measure for this study.

# 1.Post characteristics: 
## 1.1.Popularity

### Page views

This is the most general metric, representing how many views the post
received. Views do not distinguish repeated views by the same person.

```{r, echo=T}
# str(merged)
ggplot(data=merged, mapping=aes(x=`Page views`))+
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r, echo=T}
merged$post.month <-as.numeric(merged$post.month)
merged$year_month <- paste0(merged$post.year, "-", sprintf("%02d", merged$post.month))

ggplot( data=merged, mapping=aes(y=`Page views`, x=year_month))+
          geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Number of post wiews per month", x="Month", y="Number of vews")+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))



# ggplot(data=merged, mapping=aes(x=log(`Page views`)))+
#   geom_histogram()

```

From this graph we can see that the numbers of views is increased over
time. To get a better understanding of it, lets review other metrics.

### Page visits and unique users

Visit is an instance of a user engaging with bdc website. The user can
visit a few pages of the site and re-visit them, creaing few views in
once visit.Once th user left the website, the visit is over.

There also can be many visits by the same viewer. To account for
repeated users there is "Uniques" variable. It tells us how many unique
users saw the post. The relationship will always be that

Uniques \< Visits \< Views

Lets plot them together:

```{r, echo=T}
# str(merged)
ggplot(merged, aes(x =post.date )) +
     geom_bar(aes(y = `Page views`, fill = "Page views"), stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = 0.6) +
     geom_bar(aes(y = Visits, fill = "Visits"), stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = 0.6) +
     geom_bar(aes(y = Uniques, fill = "Unique users"), stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = 0.6)    +
     labs(title = "Views, visits and unique users per month", x = "Post.date", y = "Value") + 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

This graph also shows increase in all three metrics in 2022-2023. To see
how these metrics crrespond to each other, I will calculate "visits
ratio" and "unique.ratio".

### Page unique viewers.

Becuse "Uniques" variable represents number of unique people who came to
the page and viewed it at least once, his metric represents popularity
of the post. It's distribution shows us that not all posts are equally
popular:

```{r, echo=T}
# colnames(merged)
ggplot(data=merged, mapping=aes(x=Uniques))+
  geom_histogram()
```

We can see a long tail on the right, showing that there is a number of
posts who are way more popular. If we look at the distribution of this
variable over time, we will see significant increase of average
popularity after December 2021.

```{r, echo=T}
ggplot( data=merged, mapping=aes(y=Uniques, x=merged$year_month))+
          geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Number of unique viewers per month", x="Month", y="Number of unique viewers")+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

## 1.2. Engagement metrics:

### Visit ratio and unique ratio:

"visits ratio" is the number of visits per total viwes. This metric
tells us how often the page being re-viewed. The lower the ratio means
that the page was viewed more times during single visit. Since repeated
view can be considered a higher engagement, the lower visit ratio
indicates higher engagement.

"unique ratio" - number of unique users per total views. It is telling
us how often the same person re-visited the post. Lower ratio indicates
repeated users, therefore higher engagement.

Both ratios are always in the range of 0 - 1.

```{r, echo=T}
  merged <- merged %>%
     mutate(uniques.ratio = Uniques / `Page views`)%>%
      mutate(visits.ratio = Visits / `Page views`)
# str(merged)

     ggplot(merged, aes( y = uniques.ratio, x =post.date, )) +
          geom_point(color ="green" )    +
          labs(title = "Unique.ratio per post ", x = "Post.date", y = "Value") + 
          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  

      ggplot(merged, aes( y = visits.ratio, x =post.date, )) +
          geom_point(color ="blue" )    +
          labs(title = "Visits.ratio per post ", x = "Post.date", y = "Value") + 
          theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
     
```

From the two graphs above we can see that the two variables are
distributed very similarly.

If we plot them against each other and visualize their correlation, we
can see that they highly correlated especially in higher values.

```{r, echo=T}
      plot(merged$uniques.ratio, merged$visits.ratio)
correlation <- cor(merged$uniques.ratio, merged$visits.ratio)
correlation
```

Density of the distribution also showing that most posts are visited
once and by unique users, i.e. post is read once by each user.

```{r, echo=T}
# DENSITY DISTRIBUTION HERE 
     
```

### Exit rate

This variable is measuring how many people visited the page and then
left the website after the first view. This metric is the best measure
of engagement for all users, as it represents the first step after being
exposed to the post - either quitting the site or remaining on the site.

Here can see the distribution of this variable :

```{r, echo=T}
# str(merged)
merged$`Exit rate` <- as.numeric(sub("%", "", merged$`Exit rate`)) / 100

ggplot(data=merged, mapping=aes(x=`Exit rate`))+
  geom_histogram()

```

We can also see consistent increase of this value ovr time, similar to
the trend seen before:

```{r, echo=T}
ggplot(merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=`Exit rate`, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "distribution of `Exit rate` per post ", y = "Exit rate" , x="Month")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Number of reactions

This represents total amount of likes and dislikes of comments per
post.To like/dislike the comment, user doesn't have to log in.

```{r, echo=T}
# merged$year_month 
# colnames(merged)

ggplot(data=merged, mapping=aes(x=post.total.likes))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title=" Number of all reactions per post")
```

Since we already saw that there is large variability in popularity of
posts, which can natually impact absolute amount of reactions. To
account for number of views, we calculate reactions.ratio:

```{r, echo=T}
  merged <- merged %>%
     mutate(reactions.ratio = post.total.likes / `Page views`)
  
# str(merged)
ggplot(merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=reactions.ratio, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "distribution of reactions ", y = "Percentage of reactions " )+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq (from=0, to= 10000, by= 100)) + 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

The absolute number of reactions and the ratio appear to decrease over
time.

### Number of comments: engagement metric for subset of readers. Absolute and per views.

To comment on the requires logging in from a user, which is an indicator
of greater engagement of an individual user. Therefore this variable
represents engagement of a subset of users - more loyal readers who have
created an account.

```{r, echo=T}
# merged$year_month 
ggplot(data=merged, mapping=aes(x=n.comments))+
  geom_histogram()
```

And change in the distribution over time:

```{r, echo=T}
ggplot(merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=n.comments, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "distribution of comments per post ", y = "Number of comments" )+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq (from=0, to= 10000, by= 100)) + 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

The trend in amount of comments over time is different. While previously
reviewed variables seemed to increase over time, this variable
decreases.

We can calculate the ratio of comments per If we compare absolute values
fo comments and ratio of comments per page views, we see the decrease in
both cases, while the ratio's decrease is more dramatic:

```{r, echo=T}
  merged <- merged %>%
     mutate(comments.ratio = n.comments/ `Page views`)

ggplot(merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=comments.ratio, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "distribution of comments ratio (comments/page views) ", y = "Number of comments" )+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq (from=0, to= 10000, by= 100)) + 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

WE can see that with an increase of views (mostly driven by post
popularity), comments ratio decreeases. So, newly added viewers are not
adding to the engaged subset of readers.
<!-- It is also more likely that the users who logged and commented will return to the post page , which would correspond with the decrased in visits.ratio and uniques.ratio).  -->

The distribution of comments per post over time:

```{r, echo=T}

# str(merged)
ggplot(merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=post.total.likes, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "distribution of reactions over time  ", y = "Percentage of reactions " )+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq (from=0, to= 10000, by= 100)) + 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
  
```

## 1.3 Impact of post popularity on engagement.

As we saw in the distributions of variables above, the popularity of the
post might significantly influence its engagement. 

#### Exit rate as engagement
ets review how it is impacting exit rate :

```{r, echo=T}
ggplot(merged, mapping=aes(x=log(Uniques), y=`Exit rate` ))+
  geom_point()
summary(lm(`Exit rate`~ + log(Uniques) , data = merged))
```

#### Uniques.ratio as engagement

Since unique ratio is also engagement measure, lets see how its impacted
by popularity:

```{r, echo=T}
colnames(merged)
ggplot(merged, mapping=aes(x=log(Uniques), y=uniques.ratio ))+
  geom_point()
summary(lm(uniques.ratio~ + log(Uniques) , data = merged))
```

#### Visits ratio as engagement

Visits ratio is also engagement measure, lets see how its impacted by
popularity:

```{r, echo=T}
colnames(merged)
ggplot(merged, mapping=aes(x=log(Uniques), y=visits.ratio ))+
  geom_point()
summary(lm(visits.ratio~ + log(Uniques) , data = merged))
```

### 1.3.1 Page views as derivative from popularity and not engagement:

```{r, echo=T}
# colnames(merged)
merged <- merged %>%
     mutate(adj.page.views =`Page views` / 10000)
summary(lm(adj.page.views ~ `Exit rate`+ Uniques, data = merged))
```

This model tells us that the page.views are mostly driven by post
popularity and not impacted by user engagement.

###  

<!-- The model is showing  significant correlation between all of engagement metrics we have identified and popularity .  -->

<!-- Negative correlation with visits.ratio means that repeated views within one visit correspond with more overall views.  -->

<!-- Also "Exite rate: positively correspond with the number of views, meaning people are more likely to bounce when there are more views.  -->

<!-- I need to point out, that there are three possible scenarios when a user visiting the page:  -->

<!-- 1. They view once, then leave the website - > bounce  -->

<!-- 2. They view once, then go to different page on the website ->  (1-bounce - not reported in my dataset)  -->

<!-- 3. They view, then go to different page on the website, then return (visits ratio goes down: +1 view, while "visit" is the same)  -->

<!-- Therefore # 1 and #3 are not necessarily negatively correlated. In our data we can see that scenarios 1 and 3 are increasing  as overall page views increase. Likes ratio shows significant  no correlation with total views, indicating no connection between reactions frequency and amount of views.  -->

<!-- Correlation with comments ratio is significant and negative. We can conclude, that while more popular posts are much less commented on. -->

To summarize the review ofr relationship between post popularity and
engagement metric, we see consistent pattern of decreased engagement
with increased popularity. To explore this connection further, lets
review Sources of users that are coming to the website.

### 1.3.2. How popularity impacts engagement: Referral sources.

The website analytics provides information on where the viewers are
coming from to the blog page. for example, if people clicked on the blog
link posted on FaceBook, that would be referral from social media. If
people clicked on the blog link within BDC website, that would be "BDC
referral visit".

There are 5 sources of referrals, each corresponding with a variable in
the data set. Variable's value is a number of visits from this referral
source.

```         
    "Search + amp referral visits"
    "Direct (non-email) referral visits"
    "Other website referral visits"
    "Social referral visits"
    "BDC referral visits"
    "Visits when post was on LL HP" 
```

```{r, echo=T}
#renaming variables for convenience: 
merged<-merged%>%
  rename(google ="Search + amp referral visits",
         direct ="Direct (non-email) referral visits",
         other.web = "Other website referral visits",
          social= "Social referral visits",
          bdc= "BDC referral visits",
          ll= "Visits when post was on LL HP" )

ggplot(merged, mapping=aes(x=post.date))+
  geom_point(aes(y=google), color="red")+
  geom_point(aes(y=direct), color="green")+
  geom_point(aes(y=other.web), color="yellow")+
  geom_point(aes(y=social), color="purple")+
  geom_point(aes(y=bdc), color="blue")+
  geom_point(aes(y=ll), color="pink")  +
  labs(title = "referral sources per post ", y = "Number of referrals" , x="Post")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

This graph clearly demonstrates increase of "Search + amp referral
visits" after December 2021, while other referral sources maintain the
same level over time. This increase matches changes observed in
popularity ( Page Views), and engagement metrics that are highly
correlated with popularity. It also doubles views of the posts in many
cases and might significanly influence our model and conclusions.

### "Second wave" causes:

Some posts demonstrate increased amount of views, coming from search
engines. Some data shows, that these views are coming 2-3 days after the
post date (ADD DATA HERE ).

--------- Unfortunately, since views data is at the post level, and not
distributed by date

We are interested to find out, what characteristics of the post (prior
to it being picked up by google), correlate with its appearance on
google news.

Number of comments within 1st 10 hours from the post -\> google wave

```{r, echo=T}
#  calculating number of comments within first 10 hours 

# date and time of the post 
post.date  <-comments.data %>%
  group_by(post_id)%>%
  arrange(written_at)%>%
  summarize(post.dt = first(written_at), 
            n.coms =n())%>%
  filter (n.coms>100)%>%
  select(post_id, post.dt, n.coms)%>%
arrange(desc(post_id))
head(post.date )

# Calculating age of the post 
comments.data <- merge( comments.data , post.date , by = "post_id", all = TRUE)
comments.data <-comments.data %>%
  mutate (age = difftime(  written_at,post.dt, units = "hours"), 
          early = ifelse(age<10, 1, 0))

early.coms  <-comments.data%>%
  group_by(post_id)%>%
  arrange(written_at)%>%
  summarize(early.sum = sum(early), 
            n.coms =n())%>%
  filter (n.coms>100)%>%
  select(post_id, early.sum)%>%
arrange(desc(post_id))

# Adding number of early comments to merged dataset:
merged <- merge( merged, early.coms , by = "post_id", all = TRUE)

head(merged )
```

Now, as I calculated number of early comments for all posts, I can see
if that number correlated with google referrals

```{r, echo=T}

merged.2<-merged%>%
  filter(google>10000)

correlation.2 <- cor(merged.2$early.sum, merged.2$google)
correlation.2
plot(merged.2$early.sum, merged.2$google)

summary(lm(google ~early.sum, data=merged.2))

```

We can see significant connection between early comments and google
referrals above 10000 visits. However, R\^2 is low in this model, which
suggests that there are other factors that are not considered in this
model. I will explore how days of the week and time of the post
contribute to this relationship.

```{r, echo=T}
# calculating day of the week for the post: 
colnames(comments.data)
# Calculating age of the post 
library(lubridate)
comments.data <-comments.data %>%
  mutate (weekday = wday(post.dt, label = TRUE), 
          weekend = ifelse(weekday =="Fri" | weekday == "Sat", 1, 0))

# class(week.days$weekday)
# levels(week.days$weekday) 
# week.days$weekend

weekdays <-comments.data %>%
  group_by(post_id)%>%
  arrange(written_at)%>%
  summarize(post.weekday = first(weekday), 
            post.weekend =first(weekend),
            n.coms =n())%>%
  filter (n.coms>100)%>%
  select(post_id, post.weekday,post.weekend )%>%
arrange(desc(post_id))

# Adding number of early comments to merged dataset:
merged <- merge( merged, weekdays , by = "post_id", all = TRUE)
colnames(merged)

# levels(merged$post.weekday)
```

### Adding weekdays to the model

```{r, echo=T}

merged.2<-merged %>%
  filter(google>10000)

merged.3<-merged %>%
  filter(post.date>01/01/2022)

# correlation.2 <- cor(merged.weekdays$early.sum, merged.weekdays$google)
# correlation.2
 plot(merged$post.weekday, merged$google)

summary(lm(log(google) ~early.sum +post.weekday , data=merged.2))

# table(merged.weekdays$post.weekday)

ggplot (merged, mapping =aes(x=early.sum, y=google, color =post.weekday))+
  geom_point( ) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  labs(title = "All google referrals and early comments", y = "Google referrals" , x="Early comments")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  facet_wrap(~post.weekday)

ggplot (merged.3, mapping =aes(x=early.sum, y=google, color =post.weekday))+
  geom_point( ) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  labs(title = "Google referraps by erarly comments. After 1/1/2022", y = "Google referrals" , x="Early comments")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  facet_wrap(~post.weekday)

ggplot (merged.2, mapping =aes(x=early.sum, y=google, color =post.weekday))+
  geom_point( ) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  labs(title = "Google referrals over 10K and early comments", y = "Google referrals" , x="Early comments")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  facet_wrap(~post.weekday)




```

Our hypothesis that large amount of early comments triggers google
referrals did not stand on its own. We can see some significant
correlation between early comments and google referrals, but low
coefficient and high deviation from predicated vlaues (low R\^2) suggest
that there are other , more influencial, factors that were not
considered. To look for other factors, lets review other available
variables in the dataset.

## 1.4.Conclusion

As we reviewed a variety of engagement metric, I found 1. that they are
all strongly correlated to each other and influenced by post popularity:
Engagement overall decreases as popularity increases.

In our further analysis I will need to include "Uniques" variable in the
model to control for popularity

2.  Also as a result of exploration of engagement metrics, we can
    distinguish two types of users: superficial visitors and loyal
    readers. The main difference is that loyal readers have created
    accounts and therefore can comment. As we see an increase in
    popularity, the loyal readers activity does not increase
    (n.comments), in fact quite opposite - it decreases. Such decrease
    needs further valiudation exploration of causes.

The difference in types of readers must be considered when addressing
our main hypothesis whether authors engagement and other factors impacts
reader's engagement.

# 2. Independent variables (IV):

#### Authors comments

To identify, how much the author of the blog is engaged in the post, I
will create an additional variable derived from a user_name field.

```{r, echo=T}
# str(merged)
comments.data$user_name<-  ifelse (is.na(comments.data$user_name), 0, comments.data$user_name)
comments.data$author<-  ifelse (comments.data$user_name=="MeredithGoldstein", 1, 0)

comments.grouped <-comments.data %>%
  group_by(post_id)%>%
  summarize(n.comments=n(),
            author.sum = sum(author))

# dim(comments.grouped )
# colnames(comments.grouped )
# class(comments.grouped$author.sum)

# Comments data contains rows that dont actually reporesent posts, and were crearted by web support team for troubleshooting. I need to remove these rows. They typically have very low number of comments
comments.grouped <-comments.grouped %>%
filter(n.comments >100)  # removing invalid posts created by the  website management team.

comments.grouped <-comments.grouped %>%
  select(post_id, author.sum)
 dim(comments.grouped)
 
 
#adding author.sum to main data set: 
merged <- merge( merged , comments.grouped, by = "post_id", all = TRUE)


ggplot(data=merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=author.sum, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "distribution of Author's comments by months", y = "Author's comments" , x="Month")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

This graph shows, that majority of posts have no author's comments.
However, if we look at the box plots' upper ranges, we can suggest a
trend of decrease in author's comments with time.

### Mood of the post.

This is a numerical variable, calculated as percentage of "thumbs up"
from all likes (both "thumbs up" and "thumbs down").

```{r, echo=T}
ggplot(merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=pct.positive, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "distribution of Mood per post ", y = "Mood" , x="Month")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

### Blocked comments per post.

Now I will visualize amount of blocked comments per post:

```{r, echo=T}

ggplot(merged, mapping = aes(x=year_month , y=blocked.sum, fill=year_month ))+
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Number Blocked comments  per post ", y = "Number of blocked comments per post" , x="Month")+ 
     theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

# 3. Creating the model for main hypothesis testing

Now as we reviewed Independent variables,I will
create a model : 

## 3.1 Engagement of all viewers

```{r, echo=T}
# colnames(merged)
summary(lm(`Exit rate` ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum + pct.positive, data = merged))
```

This shows that engagement is decreasing with popularity and someone
increasing with author's comments. However, the contribution of authors
comments is very small.

## 3.2 Engagement of loyal viewers 

Now we will use loyal readers engagement as DV:

```{r, echo=T}
summary(lm(n.comments ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum + pct.positive, data = merged))
summary(lm(n.comments ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum + pct.positive +blocked.sum, data = merged))

# summary(lm(comments.ratio ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum + pct.positive , data = merged))
# summary(lm(comments.ratio ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum + pct.positive +blocked.sum, data = merged))

```

Number of comments, representing engagement is somewhat impacted by
three independent variables, but this moder has low R\^2 , which
suggests that there are other factors impacting loyal reader's
engagement that a re not considered in this model.

### Adding a weekday:

Adding the weekday of the post ad additional IV increases R\^2 and shows
significance for one of the levels:

```{r, echo=T}
summary(lm(n.comments ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum + pct.positive +blocked.sum +post.weekday, data = merged))
summary(lm(`Exit rate` ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum + pct.positive+blocked.sum +post.weekday, data = merged))
```

### Adding early comments:

Measuring how early comments impact engagement:

```{r, echo=T}
merged<- merged %>%
  mutate (e.rate = `Exit rate`*10000)
summary(lm(e.rate ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum +post.weekday +early.sum, data = merged))

summary(lm(e.rate ~ log(Uniques) + author.sum+early.sum, data = merged))
```

The model's predictive value is pretty good (probably due to popularity
being included) : 0.77. It also appears that this connection We can
check it, by excluding the popularity, as see that R\^2 drops
dramatically:

```{r, echo=T}
summary(lm(e.rate ~ author.sum+early.sum, data = merged))
```


# 4. Conlusion

This study explored the connection between user's online engagement and bolg's author engagement.  To do so, we also analyzed the impact of post popularity on engagement. 


```{r, echo=T}
knitr::include_graphics("C:\\Users\\Diana\\OneDrive - University Of Massachusetts Medical School\\Documents\\R\\R working directory\\DACSS\\603\\my study files for dacss603\\FP diagram .png")
```

The results showed that the post popularity is the major factor for online engagement and is negatively correlated with it. i.e. more popular posts tend to be less engaging.    

We also identified two groups of users, whose engagement is measured with different metrics. We explored how blog author's comments impact engagement of each group. We found  than there is no significant impact of authors engagement on users engagement.  Such characteristics, as post mood and blocked comments also showed no connection with engagement of either groups of users. 


# For discussion: 
not sure what to do with this:

I will add other variables in the model to see if any other metrics also
contribute:

```{r, echo=T}

summary(lm(`Page views` ~ `Exit rate`+  Uniques +comments.ratio+ author.sum +pct.positive , data = merged))
summary(lm(`Page views` ~  Uniques + author.sum  , data = merged))
summary(lm(Uniques  ~  author.sum  , data = merged))

```

While engagement metrics (exit rate and comments) did not show
significant contribution, authors comment appeared significant in this
model. - this is really out of place, i just don't want to lose this.
