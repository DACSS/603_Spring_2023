12,1,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,3,this is somewhat helpful because if the student understands what those values in the equation mean/ where to find them then this response would explain how to calculate it.  However if the student was more confused as to how that calculation worked or was to be used than this would not be as helpful.,0,301
12,2,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,Explains what the certain value is that you use to base whether or not you reject null. Direct response to their question,0,121

12,4,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,They agree that they don't know what the issue is or how to do it. So then someone else or the instructor could look if the answer key is wrong or further explain how to do it.,0,176
12,5,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,Clearly explains and provides a chart/ demonstration,0,52
12,6,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,3,Would be more helpful if they finished the example they gave or did not include that at all as it is kinda distracting.,0,119
12,7,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,gives the person a direct place to look for a clear explanation and to hopefully see how to solve the problems. also reassures them that the problem was hard so they don't feel discouraged,1,188
12,8,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,As long as the person understands how to apply this formula it was very helpful. Maybe to be more helpful add a description of what any values (like r) mean. Other than that this is really good.,0,194

12,10,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,"I think when people provide a clear place to look for an explanation it is super helpful.  However it would be more helpful if they provided a description with this as well, in case the person doesn't have the textbook or needed a further explanation.",0,251
12,11,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,It answers the persons question as to how to find Q1 and Q3 when looking at the boxplot.  However it also adds an additional question of how to find the IQR so now further responses are required.,0,195

12,15,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,3,Only answers the first question and not the second one.,0,55
12,16,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,3,"reassures them that it is difficult, but doesn't explain how to do it or solve the problem. But does draw attention to that type of problem so the instructor could notice it and work on it more.",1,194

12,19,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,It provides the equations and an example but the format of them is very confusing. Adding in a place to look in the textbook or lectures for more information would be really helpful for this.,0,191
12,20,2,1,4,3,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,"Gives the information and step by step process for solving it. If it wanted to be even more helpful they could add the visual they referred to that would make it more clear, but other than that it is a good explanation.",0,219

14,2,2,1,4,5,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,"They could have gone more in depth as to why although they did answer the question. Maybe address why the student thought what the answer was is wrong, and why the actual rule is right.",0,185
14,3,2,1,4,5,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,"I think there is a formula that is used for box plots, and although the person is right I think they could have given them the formula (something like Q1/Q3 +/- 1.5*IQR).",0,170

14,7,2,1,4,5,1,3,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,"This was slightly helpful because although the response did not offer an explanation, they gave an empirical direction and place in the textbook to look to find more help. They also indicated they struggled as well so the student knows they aren't alone.",1,254

41,8,1,1,4,4,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,3,"While giving the formula helps, it's something that can easily be found in the notebook or on Google. It might be more helpful to explain the process of finding the RMSE than just giving the formula.",0,199
41,9,1,1,4,4,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,The helper is empathetic and follows through with a clear set of directions answering the question. They also give an example so the student has a way to check if they understand the concept correctly.,1,201

42,10,1,1,4,4,1,3,2,1,5,5,4,5,4,It is good that they found and told them to go to a certain place for the best help. It would be better if they explained it as well.,0,133

56,4,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,1,This person is just tagging along with the initial post. It doesn't help the asker nor the responder if you simply say that you're struggling too.,0,146
56,5,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,The person who responded did it in a timely manner and not only provided pictures but brought in a class example and explained it clearly.,0,138

56,7,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,The person provided textbook pages to guide the asker but didn't offer any help - it is likely the student already tried looking the textbook too.,0,146
56,8,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,The question was asking for the RMSE and the response was just that. They answered the question with the equation but probably could have offered an example.,0,157
56,9,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,Person was empathetic in their response and gave a detailed description of how they solved the problem with their example. Great response!,1,138

56,15,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,3,The person responding only responds to half of the question. They left the second question unanswered so it is not as helpful.,0,126
56,16,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,1,The person did not offer any assistance. They simply agreed that they had the same issue and nothing was solved from this.,0,122
56,17,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,Perfect! Walked the person through each step and offered clear assistance for figuring out what everything meant and why the calculations were being made.,0,154
56,18,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,The answer is pretty straightforward so the person responding did a good job here. They also point to the textbook for extra help.,0,130
56,19,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,3,The person walks the asker through how to solve for a confidence interval nicely but they didn't address where to start so it's not exactly helpful.,0,148
56,20,2,1,4,3,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,4,"The person did a great job of explaining how to solve for outliers. However, would it have been so hard to include their own boxplot if they offered their numbers and examples to begin with?

57,1,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,I said it was very helpful because it provides the formula to find the z statistic just like the person asked.,0,110
57,2,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,3,I think it is slightly helpful because they correct the person asking the question but they kind of do it in a mean way that could make the person who asked the question not want to ask questions anymore.,1,204
57,3,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,1,The response given to the question does not answer the original question asked and instead just gives an explanation of what box plots are.,0,139
57,4,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,1,This persons response to the question just re-asked the same question and did not provide any insight or help with the question.,0,128
57,5,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,The person completely explains how to find the median and attaches a chart to help add a visual component that helps to explain the issue even better.,0,150
57,6,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,They clearly answer the question asked by giving an equation and an example of how you can use the equation.,0,108
57,7,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,I think that this response is helpful because they are pointing to the place where the answer is while still making the person who asked the question work for the answer and figure it out themselves.,0,199
57,8,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,This answer is straight forward and answers the question in a minimal but effective way,0,87
57,9,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,They were very nice when answering this question and provided an explanation of how to do what the person asked and gave an example as well.,1,140
57,10,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,The answer given points to how to solve the question but makes the person who asked the question still use their own brain to figure it out.,0,140
57,11,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,4,I think the first part of the answer is helpful but they should not have included the second part and should have left it out and made a new post about it instead.,0,163
57,12,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,The answer given is very thoroughly described and completely explains the persons question in detail and the person writing it is very nice.,1,140
57,13,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,I think this is helpful because they answer the persons question and at the same time provide them with an outlet for more information on the topic incase they need it.,0,168
57,14,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,3,"Even though they provide an answer to the question, the beginning of their response is unnecessary and implies that the person didn't pay attention in lecture.",0,159
57,15,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,3,They answer the question but do not give an explanation for why confounders can be represented in any experiment.,0,113
57,16,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,It is a nice response because even though they don't know the answer they are showing that it is ok to not understand because they are having the same problem. This might encourage the person who asked the question to ask more questions in the future.,1,251
57,17,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,The response answers step by step on how to solve the question at hand and they do it in a easily understandable manor with enthusiasm as well.,1,143
57,18,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,This answer is very helpful because they answer the question asked and provide other resources if the person still is confused.,0,127
57,19,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,2,4,5,5,4,5,They give them the equation to solve for confidence interval and provide an example for how to use the equation,0,111

58,6,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,4,Answers the question and gives an example but does not give an answer to the example. It would help a lot to understand the question if they also give the answer,0,161

59,11,1,1,3,4,1,4,1,1,3,5,5,5,4,"It answers the first students questions but bombards them with another question. Its not necessarily a ""helpful"" tactic but it allows the answering student to have access to another student who may fill the blank in that they lack.",0,231

73,10,1,1,4,4,1,3,4,4,5,5,2,2,4,the student should have explained the steps to solve the problem in addition to including a reference,0,101

73,15,1,1,4,4,1,3,4,4,5,5,2,2,2,not all of the students questions were answered,0,47
73,16,1,1,4,4,1,3,4,4,5,5,2,2,3,the response is comforting to other students struggling but it would be more beneficial to explain everyones take on the problem,1,128
73,17,1,1,4,4,1,3,4,4,5,5,2,2,5,the answer was straight to the point,0,36
73,18,1,1,4,4,1,3,4,4,5,5,2,2,5,the answer was straight to the point and another example was given which is super helpful,0,89

73,20,1,1,4,4,1,3,4,4,5,5,2,2,5,the answer was very detailed and made sense,0,43
74,1,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,"I think this person had the right idea adding what the formula is, but there were no words. So maybe explaining what it is or adding another example would help a lot.",0,166
74,2,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,It is a short and sweet response. It answers the students question.,0,67
74,3,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,This is a very good response for this question. They add the basics of what a box plot is and how a person should read it. They then proceed to ask if there is any more needed help.,0,181
74,4,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,1,This person should not have even responded. If the question is already posted then someone who knows the answer they will ask.,0,126
74,5,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,I think this person did an effect job of answering the question but it was a very long response.,0,96
74,6,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,This person also did a good job answering this question by explaining how you find it. They also include an example as well to help the student further understand.,0,163
74,7,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,"This is helpful for the student because it gives them a resource to find different examples, and further explanations about the concept. The only issue is the student may or may not have the book.",0,196
74,8,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,Just add some concept to the formula.,0,37
74,9,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,This is another good example of a helpful response. They explain further about how to find the certain question. I wouldn't change anything.,0,140
74,10,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,Just like the other textbook one this could be very helpful with different examples and explanations. But the student may or may not have access to the book.,0,157
74,11,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,This person answered their question but then asked another question.,0,68
74,12,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,This person gives great detail about their answer. I would not change anything.,0,79
74,13,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,This person uses an explanation for the question. But also gives an example where they can find more information.,0,113
74,14,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,good response but very wordy,0,28
74,15,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,short and sweet response,0,24
74,16,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,1,"there really was no reason for this response, because the question is already there so someone who knows the answer, will answer.",0,129

74,18,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,this is helpful because it gives an example about the certain question.,0,71
74,19,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,this response is very good and has a lot of detail.,0,51
74,20,1,1,3,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I think this response is very helpful because the person responds with steps and can be very useful for the student.,0,116
76,1,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,3,The response could use a little elaboration.,0,44
76,2,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,2,The response doesn't elaborate at all on WHY that's the rule.,0,61
76,3,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,3,Good response.,0,14
76,4,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,2,"Obviously this is not helpful in terms of answering the question, but I think it can be helpful to alert professors/TAs that there are multiple students struggling with the same problem.",0,186
76,5,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,5,"Good explanation, especially if a visual is attached.",0,53
76,6,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,4,The example is helpful but it sounds like the student needs to be reminded what the actual formula is to figure out the expected value.,0,135
76,7,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,4,I do think it's helpful to point someone in the right direction as far as where in the textbook to get more information.,0,120

76,10,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,4,Good direction.,0,15
76,11,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,2,The explanation is okay but it's not helpful to use someone else's question to ask a different question.,0,104
76,12,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,3,I believe these should be accompanied by visuals.,0,49
76,13,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,1,The guidance is too vague. Which Monday? At what point in the video?,0,68
76,14,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,1,"The first sentence seems passive aggressive and unhelpful, and can make someone feel worse. Even those who view every lecture and follow along will struggle and/or forget things sometimes. The last thing students need is another kick to their confidence.",1,254
76,15,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,3,They didn't elaborate on the second question asked.,0,51
76,16,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,3,It can be helpful to know multiple students are struggling on the same problems.,0,80
76,17,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,5,A great response that thoroughly explains the formulas.,0,55
76,18,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,5,"Short but concise response, with guidance if additional information if needed.",0,78
76,19,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,4,Good breakdown of what to do but it would also be helpful to include where to find more information on why those steps are being taken.,0,135
76,20,3,1,3,5,1,3,4,1,5,5,2,5,5,I really like how the answer was broken up into steps for an easier time to follow along. The additional example too was great.,0,127
77,1,2,1,4,3,2,4,1,1,1,4,5,5,3,They gave an equation which could have been helpful but did not have in depth steps.,0,84
77,2,2,1,4,3,2,4,1,1,1,4,5,5,3,I did not understand the advice and it felt aggressive.,1,55

123,3,2,1,4,4,1,2,1,1,4,5,5,5,1,"I don't think it answers the question at all. It gives the context of what a boxplot it, but it doesn't provide the formulas for finding outliers or how one should find or use provided numbers correlating to Q1, Q2, Q3, and IQR",0,227
123,4,2,1,4,4,1,2,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,"I think replying draws extra attention to the problem they are both struggling with, but it lacks any solving strategy. The respondent could have stated what strategy they used to get their wrong answer.",0,203
123,5,2,1,4,4,1,2,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,"I think it's imperative to attach or explain an example related to the question. It helps students digest the material better than trying to only explain it in words. Although, this response is very clear and helpful just by explaining.",0,236
123,6,2,1,4,4,1,2,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,I think this is a very helpful response. The response offers an example and a denotative written explanation of finding the value. It also leaves room for the student to work it out on their own so the answer isn't given away.,0,226

123,16,2,1,4,4,1,2,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,I think it just brings attention the question they are both struggling on and allows the instructor to see a pattern of error. If they performed the same formula there isn't anything they could add.,0,198
123,17,2,1,4,4,1,2,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,I think it answers the question clearly and in detail. It doesn't give the equation away but shows the student what they need and where to find missing information.,0,164

141,3,2,2,4,4,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,It does explain certain parts of a box plot but does not mention outliers at all which would leave the person asking just as confused as before.,0,144
141,4,2,2,4,4,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,It shows the instructor/TAs that there is confusion on a certain topic that needs to be covered more in class.,0,110
141,5,2,2,4,4,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,It gave an example of how to find the median of the histogram but did not solve the problem for the student.,0,108

145,2,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,It was a small error that needed a small fix and I think that the response back is simple and explains why,0,106
145,3,1,1,4,5,1,5,1,1,4,5,5,5,2,I think that there could be a better way to elaborate on how to find the outliers by showing the formula.,0,105

179,15,1,1,4,2,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,2,The respondent discussed confounders shortly but did not describe casual links.,0,79
179,16,1,1,4,2,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,2,I feel that if the student described their answer or problem more they would have gotten more help and not just support from the respondent.,1,140

181,5,2,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,"I think it was helpful because it talks about where the 50 percents lies, but it didn't specify the ""median""",0,108
181,6,2,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,"I think this was really helpful but for the example they gave, they should solve it just so the person asking the question can solve it as well and compare their answer to the right answer, so they know they are solving it right",0,228

182,2,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,I believe that this the helpful to understand the situation but it would be better if why the p-value cannot be more than five.,0,127
182,3,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,I believe a drawing of the box plot would be more helpful.,0,58
182,4,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,1,There are no answers for this one therefore I believe the teacher should address this problem in class.,0,103
182,5,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I believe that this is a great help to the student. Because it has an example attached which the student could visualize easily.,0,128

182,10,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I like when people point out where can my problem be solved because I would be able to figure it out by myself.,0,111
182,11,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,"Well, this response would be a great start to solving the problem. However, I only measure the responses as helpful because students will still need to calculate IQR.",0,166
182,12,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,This response would be the perfect explanation because everything is explained in detail.,0,89
182,13,1,1,1,5,1,3,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,"This response would be helpful but the student who ask this question could not be able to fully understand without going through the lecture. Therefore, I rate it as helpful.",0,174

189,2,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,"I think this response is somewhat helpful, because, although it answers the student's question, I think it should go further to explain the rule. Like what it means when the p-value is less than 5.",0,197
189,3,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,2,I think it does a great job explaining how the box-lot is split up but it doesn't really answer the student's question. It should tell them about the formula for finding outliers.,0,179
189,4,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,"I would say this response is somewhat helpful because hopefully when people see that more people are having trouble with the same concept, they might be more inclined to help.",0,175
189,5,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I think this response does a great job at answering the question and even includes a graph for them to visualize their response better which is very helpful.,0,157
189,6,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,I think it should directly put the formula and define how to find the parts of the formula. I think that would make this response a little more clear.,0,150
189,7,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,I think this response is helpful even though it makes you do some additional searching. It is nice that the student included a page number because that way the student with the question can see examples that are hopefully similar to the HW questions they are struggling with.,0,275
189,8,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I think this is very helpful and right to the point. Maybe they could include where to find r if it is not clear from the question but other than that I think this response is pretty helpful.,0,191
189,9,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,"I think this student gave a model response. They reassured the student with the question that it was alright and that they were also struggling.

189,10,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I think it is very helpful when students give textbook pages for their responses. This is helpful because it will hopefully clarify more for the student than their response ever could because it will provide more detailed examples and explanations.,0,248

189,16,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,3,I don't think it is really helpful because they just claimed they were having the same problem but maybe it will show other students or even the teacher that this is a pressing question and still needs to be answered.,0,217
189,17,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I think this response does a great job of writing down each step to find the regression line equation. It goes step by step and seems easy enough to follow.,0,156
189,18,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I think this is great because it answers the question but it also tells the student where to get more information since they didn't really give reasoning as to why the average of the residuals will always be 0.,0,210
189,19,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,I think this is a helpful response but it might be helpful to explain the equation a bit more since the student asking the question had no idea where to start.,0,159
189,20,2,1,4,5,1,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,5,I think this response is great and I really like how they explain what they did with the numbers they were given. I like how the student separated their response into steps so it was very clear for the student asking the question.,0,230

204,1,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,4,They could give and explain with real numbers so the person really understands how to do it.,0,92
204,2,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,4,I don't think there was much more they could have said or explained so I think that it was pretty helpful and answered the question. They were a little harsh as well.,1,166
204,3,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,5,This was a very good response! They were very nice and also helpful. They explained everything well and I can't think of anything they could have really done any better.,1,169
204,4,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,1,I mean it's not helping in any way they were also just confused so this doesn't really even need a rating.,0,106
204,5,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,5,I think this is extremely helpful. They explain everything well and describe and even drew a chart for the person.,0,114
204,6,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,5,They explained this very well without giving the answer which I think is nice so the person asking can still figure it out and practice. But they still explain how one would do it to solve the question.,0,202
204,7,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,2,"I mean yes they helped somewhat, but also they could have just explained how to do it instead of agreeing they were hard and telling them somewhere else to look.",0,161

204,11,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,4,"They did a pretty good job at explaining this, they probably should have asked their own question separately and just left it answering their question. They could have also used real values to explain it.",0,204
204,12,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,5,They gave a very in-depth explanation with an example which I think was extra helpful. They also ended with a smiley face which I think was nice.,1,145
204,13,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,4,This was pretty helpful. They explained what it was and gave more information on where they could find the steps/more examples. They could have also said where to find n or give an example.,0,189
204,14,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,5,They explain it step by step which was very useful and they provided the equations which was nice too.,0,102
204,15,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,3,They didn't answer both questions but the answer they gave for the first one was good.,0,86

204,18,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,5,"This was simple but helpful. There isn't much else they could say about it since the answer is always 0, and they provide a place to provide more information.",0,158
204,19,2,1,4,5,1,5,2,1,5,5,4,5,5,They give the equation and an example using actual numbers which is helpful so I think they did a very nice job answering it.,0,125

212,4,1,1,1,4,1,4,1,1,4,5,5,5,1,not helpful because the person who responded need help themselves.,0,66
