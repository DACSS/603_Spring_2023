## Education/Work Background

My background is in qualitative research - I have an MA, where I focused on sociocultural studies of sport and leisure (my thesis was about the use of narratives about youth, masculinity, and nationalism in the production of advertising, using NHL player Sidney Crosby as a case study). Degree-wise, I also have a BAH in Sociology and a Bachelor of Physical and Health Education (specializing in cultural studies and sociology of sport). Certificate-wise, I have a certificate in Strategic Public Relations and am one course shy of my certificate in Digital Strategy and Communications Management (maybe this summer!)

After spending the first 10ish years of my career in non-profit sport management, I made the decision to refocus myself on communications, research, and analysis work. I worked on campus in marketing and communications before moving to my current role as a social media data analyst for a higher ed adjacent agency. In my day-to-day work I pick apart what's being posted online about our partner schools to help them reach their strategic marketing and communications goals. 

## R experience

I started using R in 601, which I took in Fall 2022. I would still very much consider myself a beginner and am looking forward to continuing to build my skills which will hopefully help me to continue to  broaden my research and analysis capabilities!

## Research interests

Cultural studies, higher education, social justice

## Hometown

Toronto, Ontario, Canada

## Hobbies

Hockey, hiking, canoe tripping, powerlifting, writing, chasing my two kids around!

## Fun fact

Why is this always the most difficult question to answer? I don't know if it's fun, but I guess it's a fact; I default to Canadian english, so I have to make sure I edit all work school/work writing to make sure I've eliminated all the extraneous "u"s.
