## Education/Work Background
I graduated from UMass Amherst SBS in 2017 with a double major in Communications and Sociology. After graduation, I began a career in market research. Throughout the last five years my career has included project management, full cycle survey research, cleaning and weighting data, preparing and writing reports in various formats, and vendor/client management. I currently work at S&P Global Market Intelligence as a Research Analyst with a focus in consumer Digital Endpoints research.

## R experience
I have no experience in R at all outside of taking 601 last semester. In my day to day I typically use Excel, SPSS, and various online data processing platforms.

## Research interests
Given my background in Comm/Sociology, I am personally interested in social science research and topics like wealth inequality, or any data about the way humans behave. Professionally, I am interested in researching ways we anticipate the world will look different in the coming years - things like fin-tech changing financial planning accessibility, or the pandemic changing the way we work forever. 

## Hometown
Currently living in Providence, RI but from Connecticut

## Hobbies
Painting, writing poetry, going to music festivals, and traveling

## Fun fact
I have two orange brother cats that are one year old, and they love to make appearances on Zoom calls :)
