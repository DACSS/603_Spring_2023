Most of the observations are close to the mean. Very few observations are close to the margins (0 and 15).\n\n\n\nThe distribution and mean of the probability density of Lung Capacity can be shown in the box plots below, separated by genders ‘Male’ and ‘Female’\n\n\nCode\n# Create a Box Plot with Lung Capacity on y-axis, grouped by gender\nboxplot(LungCap~ Gender, data = df)\n\n# Add a title\ntitle(\"Lung Capacity: Males vs. Females\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot suggests that there is no significant difference between lung capacity of females and males, as the error bars of each boxplot significantly overlap. Additionally, the mean of the probability density of lung capacity appear to be close between female and male constituents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a Box Plot with Lung Capacity on y-axis, grouped by populations that smoke or do not smoke \nboxplot(LungCap~ Smoke, data = df)\n\n# Add a title\ntitle(\"Lung Capacity: Smokers vs. Non-Smokers\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot suggests that smokers have a higher lung capacity than non-smokers, which is counter-intuitive.\n#c Next, we will explore the differences of lung capacity of non-smokers and smokers, broken down by age group, as shown in the boxplot below. The green color is used to call out groups that do smoke while the blue color is used to call out groups that do not smoke.\n\n\nCode\n#Group respondents into specific Age Groups \nAgeGroups <- cut(df$Age, breaks=c(0,13,15,17,19), labels=c('<13','14-15','16-17','>=18'))\nlevels(AgeGroups)\n\n\n[1] \"<13\"   \"14-15\" \"16-17\" \">=18\" \n\n\nCode\n#Create a stratified box plot based on two factors: Smoking vs. Nonsmoking and Age groups\nboxplot(df$LungCap~df$Smoke*AgeGroups, ylab=\"LungCap\", main=\"LungCap vs. Smoke, by AgeGroup\", las = 2, col=c(4,3))\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these boxplots, you can see that when you separate the smoking and nonsmoking groups by age, the smokers have a higher lung capacity than non-smokers. This is because age is a confounding variable, with young people gaining lung capacity as they have bigger bodies, and with older peope generally smoking more than younger people . Once you take out age from consideration and compare “apples to apples” people of the same age but differences in whether they smoke or not, you can see that smoking DOES have a negative effect on lung capacity."

Is your answer different from the one in part c. What could possibly be going on here?\nFrom the age group data above, we can ascertain that in the majority of age groups (three of the four), non-smokers have greater mean lung capacity than smokers, and yet when we calculated the mean lung capacity solely for smokers/non-smokers (ie. not accounting for age), smokers had greater mean lung capacity. The mean lung capacities for smokers/non-smokers (again, not accounting for age) are also lower than one might expect considering that when we do account for age, most of the represented groups have a higher mean lung capacity. This would suggest that something is skewing our results.\nOne way to gain insight into this is to examine how many respondents fell into each age/smoking status category.\n\n\nCode\n# Count number of responses in each age group who are smokers/non-smokers\nAgeSmokeLC %>%\n  count(AgeGroup, Smoke)\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  AgeGroup     Smoke     n\n  <chr>        <chr> <int>\n1 13 and Under no      401\n2 13 and Under yes      27\n3 14-15        no      105\n4 14-15        yes      15\n5 16-17        no       77\n6 16-17        yes      20\n7 18 and Over  no       65\n8 18 and Over  yes      15\n\n\nThere are more non-smoking individuals aged 13 and Under in this sample than all other categories combined. Accordingly, data from this group can (and has) skewed the overall non-smoking mean."

Here, the lung capacity for non-smokers is higher than the lung capacity for smokers in youngest age range, but the other age ranges display the opposite relationship. This may be due to the possibility that smoking has a stronger influence on lungCapacity the longer you smoke. So younger folks may have only smoked for a year or so, while folks in the older age ranges have spent many more years smoking.

This is especially evident when comparing the lowest age group (0-13) versus the rest of them, but between the two oldest age groups (16-17 vs 18+), this is the least evident. This makes sense as the greatest physical growth usually happens earlier in life - from childhood to puberty - but then this slows down in the late teens and it almost entirely stops during young adulthood.\n\n\n\nCompare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group.

I previously found that the lung capacity mean for non-smokers was less than the smoking counterpart; however, this new box plot suggests that most non-smoking age groups actually have better lung capacity than smokers. The only age group where this condition isn’t met is in the youngest ages (0-13) so it is likely that this group that is skewing the overall smoker versus non-smoker analysis."

The first three columns are labeled: LungCap, Age, and Height and they are all classified as double, which is a type of numeric variable. The last three columns are Smoke, Gender, and Caesarean, which are all classified as character variables. LungCap refers to the lung capacity of the person, Age, Height, and Gender all describe the relevant characteristics of that person. Smoke is a dichotomous variable which records whether a person smokes or not. Caesarean is also a dichotomous variable that reflects whether a person was born by a caesaren or not.\n\n\nThe distribution of the LungCap variable looks as follows:\n\n\nCode\nhist(df$LungCap)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram suggests that the distribution is close to a normal distribution. Most of the observations are close to the mean.\n\n\n\nWe can use the boxplot function to compare the distribution of the LungCap variable with respect to males and females.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Gender, data=df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using pipes, the group_by() and the summarize() functions we can take a look at the mean lung capacity of smokers and non-smokers. The results are counter-intuitive: it looks as though the mean lung capacity for those who smoke is larger than those who do not.\n\n\nCode\ndf %>% \n  group_by(Smoke) %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean_LungCap\"=mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke Mean_LungCap\n  <chr>        <dbl>\n1 no            7.77\n2 yes           8.65\n\n\n\n\n\nTo examine the relationship between smoking and lung capacity within age groups we can use the mutate() and case_when() functions and piping to create an ordinal variable that captures different age groups:\n\n\nCode\ndf <- df %>% \n  mutate(AgeGroups = case_when(\n    Age<=13 ~ \"a. Less than or equal to 13\",\n    Age==14 | Age==15 ~ \"b. 14 or 15\", \n    Age==16 | Age==17 ~ \"c. 16 or 17\",\n    Age>=18 ~ \"d. Greater than or equal to 18\"))\n\n\nWith this new variable we can more easily compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. The following tables show the mean lung capacity for study subjects arranged by age group, first for those who reported not smoking and second for those who did report smoking:\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfilter(df, Smoke==\"no\") %>% \n  group_by(AgeGroups) %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean_LungCap\"=mean(LungCap)) %>% \n  arrange(AgeGroups)\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  AgeGroups                      Mean_LungCap\n  <chr>                                 <dbl>\n1 a.

Greater than or equal to 18        10.5 \n\n\nThis data shows that lung capacity generally increases with age.\nIt is interesting to note that on average all age groups that did not smoke had a higher lung capacity except for those who were 13 or under. The group found to have the lowest lung capacity in the whole dataset were children 13 or under who did not smoke.\nSince the finding related to this age group (study subjects aged 13 or under) was unexpected, I used the filter() and table() functions to examine the sample size of this group.\n\n\nCode\nThirteen_and_under <- filter(df, AgeGroups == \"a. Less than or equal to 13\")\ntable(Thirteen_and_under$Smoke)\n\n\n\n no yes \n401  27 \n\n\nAccording to this data, there were only 27 children in this study 13 years old or under who reported smoking. In order to better understand the relationship between age, smoking status and lung capacity we could run another study with a larger sample size."
