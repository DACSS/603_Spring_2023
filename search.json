Here, the lung capacity for non-smokers is higher than the lung capacity for smokers in youngest age range, but the other age ranges display the opposite relationship. This may be due to the possibility that smoking has a stronger influence on lungCapacity the longer you smoke. So younger folks may have only smoked for a year or so, while folks in the older age ranges have spent many more years smoking.

While the mean of both genders is close to each other (~8), males’ interquartile range is slightly higher (approximately from 6.5 to 10) when compared to the females’ (approximately from 6 to 9).\n\n\n\nCompare the mean lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers.

These results do not make sense, as we would expect non-smokers to have greater lung capacity.\n\n\n\nExamine the relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity within age groups: “less than or equal to 13”, “14 to 15”, “16 to 17”, and “greater than or equal to 18”.\n\n\nCode\nage_groups <- df %>% \n  mutate(\n    # Create categories\n    AgeGroup = case_when(\n      Age <= 13            ~ \"0 to 13\",\n      Age == 14 | Age == 15 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n      Age == 16 | Age == 17 ~ \"16 to 17\",\n      Age >= 18             ~ \"18 and above\"\n    ),\n    # Convert to factor\n    AgeGroup = factor(\n      AgeGroup,\n      level = c(\"0 to 13\", \"14 to 15\",\"16 to 17\", \"18 and above\")\n    )\n  )\n\nboxplot(LungCap~AgeGroup, data=age_groups)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot suggests that the greater the age, the greater the lung capacity. This is especially evident when comparing the lowest age group (0-13) versus the rest of them, but between the two oldest age groups (16-17 vs 18+), this is the least evident. This makes sense as the greatest physical growth usually happens earlier in life - from childhood to puberty - but then this slows down in the late teens and it almost entirely stops during young adulthood.\n\n\n\nCompare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. Is your answer different from the one in part c. What could possibly be going on here?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nage_groups %>% ggplot(aes(x=AgeGroup, y=LungCap, fill=Smoke)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is different than what I found in 1.C. I previously found that the lung capacity mean for non-smokers was less than the smoking counterpart; however, this new box plot suggests that most non-smoking age groups actually have better lung capacity than smokers. The only age group where this condition isn’t met is in the youngest ages (0-13) so it is likely that this group that is skewing the overall smoker versus non-smoker analysis."

The first three columns are labeled: LungCap, Age, and Height and they are all classified as double, which is a type of numeric variable. The last three columns are Smoke, Gender, and Caesarean, which are all classified as character variables. LungCap refers to the lung capacity of the person, Age, Height, and Gender all describe the relevant characteristics of that person. Smoke is a dichotomous variable which records whether a person smokes or not. Caesarean is also a dichotomous variable that reflects whether a person was born by a caesaren or not.\n\n\nThe distribution of the LungCap variable looks as follows:\n\n\nCode\nhist(df$LungCap)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram suggests that the distribution is close to a normal distribution. Most of the observations are close to the mean.\n\n\n\nWe can use the boxplot function to compare the distribution of the LungCap variable with respect to males and females.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Gender, data=df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using pipes, the group_by() and the summarize() functions we can take a look at the mean lung capacity of smokers and non-smokers. The results are counter-intuitive: it looks as though the mean lung capacity for those who smoke is larger than those who do not.\n\n\nCode\ndf %>% \n  group_by(Smoke) %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean_LungCap\"=mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke Mean_LungCap\n  <chr>        <dbl>\n1 no            7.77\n2 yes           8.65\n\n\nWe can use the mutate() and case_when() functions and piping to create an ordinal variable that captures different age groups:\n\n\nCode\ndf <- df %>% \n  mutate(AgeGroups = case_when(\n    Age<=13 ~ \"a. Less than or equal to 13\",\n    Age==14 | Age==15 ~ \"b. 14 or 15\", \n    Age==16 | Age==17 ~ \"c. 16 or 17\",\n    Age>=18 ~ \"d. Greater than or equal to 18\"))\n\n\nWith this new variable we can examine the relationship between lung capacity, age, and smoking status. The following tables show the mean lung capacity for study subjects arranged by age group, first for those who reported not smoking and second for those who did report smoking:\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfilter(df, Smoke==\"no\") %>% \n  group_by(AgeGroups) %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean_LungCap\"=mean(LungCap)) %>% \n  arrange(AgeGroups)\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  AgeGroups                      Mean_LungCap\n  <chr>                                 <dbl>\n1 a.

Greater than or equal to 18        10.5 \n\n\nIt is interesting to note that on average all age groups that did not smoke had a higher lung capacity except for those who were 13 or under. The group found to have the lowest lung capacity in the whole dataset were children 13 or under who did not smoke.\nSince the finding related to this age group (study subjects aged 13 or under) was unexpected, I used the filter() and table() functions to examine the sample size of this group.\n\n\nCode\nThirteen_and_under <- filter(df, AgeGroups == \"a. Less than or equal to 13\")\ntable(Thirteen_and_under$Smoke)\n\n\n\n no yes \n401  27 \n\n\nAccording to this data, there were only 27 children in this study 13 years old or under who reported smoking. In order to better understand the relationship between age, smoking status and lung capacity we could run another study with a larger sample size."
