Most of the observations are close to the mean. Very few observations are close to the margins (0 and 15).\n\n\n(1b) The probability distribution of the LungCap with respect to gender is as follows:\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(df$LungCap ~ df$Gender)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1c) The mean lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers can be found in the table below:\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise_at(vars(LungCap), list(name = mean))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke  name\n  <chr> <dbl>\n1 no     7.77\n2 yes    8.65\n\n\nThese means are not what I would expect. It looks like those who smoke (“yes”) have a higher long capacity (8.65) than those who do not smoke (7.77).\n\n\n(1d) The relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity within age groups\n\n\nCode\n#Age groups defined by:\n#“less than or\n#equal to 13”, \n#“14 to 15”, \n#“16 to 17”, \n#“greater than or equal to 18”.\n\n# Create variable\ndf <- df %>% \n  mutate(age_group = case_when(\n      Age <= 13 ~ \"0-13\",\n      Age > 13 & Age < 16 ~ \"14-15\",\n      Age > 15 & Age < 18 ~ \"16-18\",\n      Age >= 18 ~ \">= 18\"),\n    # Convert to factor\n    age_group = factor(\n      age_group,\n      level = c(\"0-13\", \"14-15\",\"16-18\", \">= 18\")))\n\nView(df)\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(age_group,Smoke) %>%\n  summarise_at(vars(LungCap), list(name = mean))\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   age_group [4]\n  age_group Smoke  name\n  <fct>     <chr> <dbl>\n1 0-13      no     6.36\n2 0-13      yes    7.20\n3 14-15     no     9.14\n4 14-15     yes    8.39\n5 16-18     no    10.5 \n6 16-18     yes    9.38\n7 >= 18     no    11.1 \n8 >= 18     yes   10.5 \n\n\nCode\ndbinom(x=8,size=8,prob=.5)\n\n\n[1] 0.00390625\n\n\nCode\ndbinom(x=6,size=8,prob=.5)\n\n\n[1] 0.109375\n\n\n\n\n(1e) Compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x=age_group, y=LungCap, color = Smoke)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nThis data visualization makes more sense for what we expect from lung capacity when comparing smokers to non smokers.

Most of the observations are close to the mean. Very few observations are close to the margins (0 and 15).\n\n\n\nThe distribution and mean of the probability density of Lung Capacity can be shown in the box plots below, separated by genders ‘Male’ and ‘Female’\n\n\nCode\n# Create a Box Plot with Lung Capacity on y-axis, grouped by gender\nboxplot(LungCap~ Gender, data = df)\n\n# Add a title\ntitle(\"Lung Capacity: Males vs. Females\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot suggests that there is no significant difference between lung capacity of females and males, as the error bars of each boxplot significantly overlap. Additionally, the mean of the probability density of lung capacity appear to be close between female and male constituents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a Box Plot with Lung Capacity on y-axis, grouped by populations that smoke or do not smoke \nboxplot(LungCap~ Smoke, data = df)\n\n# Add a title\ntitle(\"Lung Capacity: Smokers vs. Non-Smokers\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot suggests that smokers have a higher lung capacity than non-smokers, which is counter-intuitive.\n#c Next, we will explore the differences of lung capacity of non-smokers and smokers, broken down by age group, as shown in the boxplot below. The green color is used to call out groups that do smoke while the blue color is used to call out groups that do not smoke.\n\n\nCode\n#Group respondents into specific Age Groups \nAgeGroups <- cut(df$Age, breaks=c(0,13,15,17,19), labels=c('<13','14-15','16-17','>=18'))\nlevels(AgeGroups)\n\n\n[1] \"<13\"   \"14-15\" \"16-17\" \">=18\" \n\n\nCode\n#Create a stratified box plot based on two factors: Smoking vs. Nonsmoking and Age groups\nboxplot(df$LungCap~df$Smoke*AgeGroups, ylab=\"LungCap\", main=\"LungCap vs. Smoke, by AgeGroup\", las = 2, col=c(4,3))\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these boxplots, you can see that when you separate the smoking and nonsmoking groups by age, the smokers have a higher lung capacity than non-smokers. This is because age is a confounding variable, with young people gaining lung capacity as they have bigger bodies, and with older peope generally smoking more than younger people . Once you take out age from consideration and compare “apples to apples” people of the same age but differences in whether they smoke or not, you can see that smoking DOES have a negative effect on lung capacity."

Compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. Is your answer different from the one in part c. What could possibly be going on here?\n\n\nCode\n# First, let's create the categories for age\n\nlung2 <-lung %>%\n  mutate(Age_Cat = case_when(\n        Age >= 0 & Age <= 13 ~ \"13 or less\",\n        Age >= 14 & Age <= 15 ~ \"14 to 15\" ,\n        Age >= 16 & Age <= 17 ~ \"16 to 17\" ,\n        Age >= 18 ~ \"18 or more\" ,\n        ))\n\nbox_plot_crop2<-ggplot(data=lung2, aes(x=Smoke, y=LungCap, fill=Smoke)) \nbox_plot_crop2+ geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n  theme (axis.text.x=element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim =  c(0, 15))+\n  labs(title=\"Box Plot - Lung Capacity\",\n        x =\"Smoke\", y = \"Density\")+\n  facet_wrap(.~Age_Cat, scales= \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this graph I can note the following:\n\nExcept for the group of 13 or less, non-smokers shows higher lung capacity compared with smokers.\nOn the other hand, seems that the Lung Capacity increases with the years regardless the smoke condition.\n\nLet’s see more detailed numbers. I want to see the Lung Capacity Means and dispersion for each group. for this we will do a crosstab showing n, mean, median and sd.\nFirst let’s see the frequencies for both variables in a crosstab.\n\n\nCode\nxtabs(~Age_Cat+Smoke, data=lung2)\n\n\n            Smoke\nAge_Cat       no yes\n  13 or less 401  27\n  14 to 15   105  15\n  16 to 17    77  20\n  18 or more  65  15\n\n\nMean Lung Capacity by Age Group and Smoke condition\n\n\nCode\nwith(lung2, tapply(LungCap, list(Age_Group=Age_Cat,Smoker=Smoke), mean) )\n\n\n            Smoker\nAge_Group           no       yes\n  13 or less  6.358746  7.201852\n  14 to 15    9.138810  8.391667\n  16 to 17   10.469805  9.383750\n  18 or more 11.068846 10.513333\n\n\nMedian Lung Capacity by Age Group and Smoke condition\n\n\nCode\nwith(lung2, tapply(LungCap, list(Age_Group=Age_Cat,Smoker=Smoke), median) )\n\n\n            Smoker\nAge_Group        no    yes\n  13 or less  6.575  7.025\n  14 to 15    9.000  8.475\n  16 to 17   10.600  9.550\n  18 or more 10.850 10.475\n\n\nStandard Deviation Lung Capacity by Age Group and Smoke condition\n\n\nCode\nwith(lung2, tapply(LungCap, list(Age_Group=Age_Cat,Smoker=Smoke), sd) )\n\n\n            Smoker\nAge_Group          no      yes\n  13 or less 2.214412 1.577728\n  14 to 15   1.546130 1.437497\n  16 to 17   1.536745 1.326136\n  18 or more 1.555139 1.250959\n\n\nClearly the lung capacity is higher for non smokers within each age group except 13 or less years old group, where the smoker’s mean (and median) is higher than non-smokers.\nAs noted before it is also clear that the lung capacity increases with the age regardless the smoke condition.\nHowever it is interesting to note that:\n\nThe number of cases in the group 13 or less is aout the 50% of the whole sample. So it is explaining the findings in the question part “c” above (higher overall Lung Capacity average for smokers).\nThe lung capacity makes a bigger jump for non-smokers from 13 or less to the next bracket (14-15 years) compared to smokers. In other words, non-smokers close the gap and exceed smokers when they pass the 13 years.\n\nIt seems that smoking in early ages affects lungs capacity and making it falling behind consistently from non-smokers as getting older."

Is your answer different from the one in part c. What could possibly be going on here?\nFrom the age group data above, we can ascertain that in the majority of age groups (three of the four), non-smokers have greater mean lung capacity than smokers, and yet when we calculated the mean lung capacity solely for smokers/non-smokers (ie. not accounting for age), smokers had greater mean lung capacity. The mean lung capacities for smokers/non-smokers (again, not accounting for age) are also lower than one might expect considering that when we do account for age, most of the represented groups have a higher mean lung capacity.

    "text": "Dataset\nThe data for this study was collected during the last month of the Fall 2021 semester at a large public university in the mid-west of the United States (Jeng et al., 2023). Students were recruited through voluntary response sampling in an online introduction to statistics course and received extra credit for participating in the study. The instructor of this course was not a member of the research team. A total of 240 students completed the survey and responses from 17 students were removed due to either missing demographics, the same rating for every example, or identical response made to more than 50% of open-ended questions. In total, responses from 223 students are included.\nThe full dataset can be found here.\n\nVariables\nTo answer the research question for the present study, the following variables have been selected. Details on these variables are included in following sections.\n\ngender\nrace\nbel_1\nbel_2\nbel_2_r\nbel_3\nbel_4\nbel_4_r\nbel_5\nbel_5_r\nbel_6\n\nUsing the above variables, additional variables were created to aid in analysis. These included 6 belonging variables with the data un-coded to show the actual response options and 6 more belonging variables as order factors. The variable bel_sum was also created to create an overall belonging score for each participant.\n\nGender\nThe responses for gender include “Man” (2) and “Woman or non-binary” (1). The researchers who collected this data explain that their were so few students who identified as non-binary that the sample was too small for a separate analysis (Jeng et al., 2023). What they did do was run all analysis twice, once with non-binary students excluded and once with this group combine with respondents who identified as women. They found their findings to be the same in both instances and therefore choose to combine these two groups. For the purpose of this study, this variable will be coded as “Male” and “Female.”\n\n\nRace/Ethnicity\nThe response options for race include “Asian or Asian American” (1), “Black or African American” (2), “Hispanic or Latino” (3), “White” (4), and “Other” (5).\n\n\nBelonging\nA total of 6 Likert questions were asked to measure social belonging which were adapted from Goodenow’s (1993) Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM) scale. Five response options (“Not at all true”, “Slightly true”, “Moderately true”, “Mostly true”, and “Completely true”) were provided to students to answer the below questions. Questions 2, 4, and 5 were reversed scored which is why 2 variables exist for each of these questions.\n\nI feel like a real part of this class\nSometimes I feel as if I don’t belong in this class\nI am included in lots of activities in this class\nI feel very different from most other students in this class\nI wish I were in a different class\nI feel proud of belonging to this

LungCap is the primary variable of interest, measuring the lung capacity of participants. Age and Height provide demographic information, indicating the age and height of each participant.\nEach row in the dataset corresponds to a unique participant and provides their values for the six variables. Smoke is a categorical variable that denotes whether the participant smokes or not. Gender is another categorical variable that identifies the gender of each participant. Cesarean is a binary variable indicating whether the participant was born via cesarean section or not.\nThe LungCap dataset may be useful in exploring the relationships between lung capacity, demographic variables, and smoking status."

The histogram and density plots indicate that the data is approximately normally distributed, with the majority of observations clustered near the mean. Specifically, the histogram shows a bell-shaped curve, with the highest frequency of observations centered around the mean value.\nThe density plot shows a smooth, symmetric curve, which closely follows the histogram and suggests that the data follows a normal distribution. These results are consistent with what we might expect, given that lung capacity is a physiological measure that is likely to vary around a central tendency. Taken together, these findings suggest that the sample data is well-behaved and that the majority of individuals in the sample have lung capacities that are close to the average value."

However, the statement argues that this result does not make sense and cannot be conclusively interpreted as a difference between smokers and non-smokers.\nThe output suggests that the lung capacity of an individual who smokes may be influenced by various biological factors unique to each person. Therefore, while smoking can be a contributing factor to reduced lung capacity, it cannot be the sole factor responsible for differences in lung capacity between smokers and non-smokers.\nThe output emphasizes that the difference in mean lung capacity between smokers and non-smokers is not a conclusive indicator of the effects of smoking on lung capacity. Other factors, such as age, gender and overall health, may also play a role in lung capacity. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors when drawing conclusions about the impact of smoking on lung capacity or other health outcomes."

Firstly, we observe that non-smokers generally have a higher lung capacity compared to smokers. This is indicated by the fact that the bars for non-smokers are consistently taller than the bars for smokers across all age groups. This observation is consistent with the known negative impact of smoking on lung function.\nSecondly, we observe that the number of smokers is relatively lower in the age group “less than or equal to 13”. This is shown by the relatively shorter bars for smokers in this age group. This observation could be due to several factors, such as lower access to cigarettes or lower rates of smoking initiation in younger age groups.\nAdditionally, we can also observe that there is a general trend of decreasing lung capacity as age increases, regardless of smoking status. This is indicated by the fact that the bars for all age groups are shorter compared to the bars for the previous age group. This trend is consistent with the natural decline in lung function that occurs with aging.\nIn summary, the above graph shows that non-smokers generally have a higher lung capacity compared to smokers, and that smoking rates are relatively lower in younger age groups. The graph also highlights the general trend of decreasing lung capacity as age increases, regardless of smoking status. These observations provide important insights into the relationship between lung capacity, smoking, and age, and can be useful for informing public health interventions and promoting healthy lifestyles."

And the correlation is also positive, so they move in same direction. We can say from these results that as the age increases, the lung capacity also increases that is they are directly proportional to each other."

The first three columns are labeled: LungCap, Age, and Height and they are all classified as double, which is a type of numeric variable. The last three columns are Smoke, Gender, and Caesarean, which are all classified as character variables. LungCap refers to the lung capacity of the person, Age, Height, and Gender all describe the relevant characteristics of that person. Smoke is a dichotomous variable which records whether a person smokes or not. Caesarean is also a dichotomous variable that reflects whether a person was born by a caesaren or not.\n\n\nThe distribution of the LungCap variable looks as follows:\n\n\nCode\nhist(df$LungCap)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram suggests that the distribution is close to a normal distribution. Most of the observations are close to the mean.\n\n\n\nWe can use the boxplot function to compare the distribution of the LungCap variable with respect to males and females.\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap ~ Gender, data=df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using pipes, the group_by() and the summarize() functions we can take a look at the mean lung capacity of smokers and non-smokers. The results are counter-intuitive: it looks as though the mean lung capacity for those who smoke is larger than those who do not.\n\n\nCode\ndf %>% \n  group_by(Smoke) %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean_LungCap\"=mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke Mean_LungCap\n  <chr>        <dbl>\n1 no            7.77\n2 yes           8.65\n\n\n\n\n\nTo examine the relationship between smoking and lung capacity within age groups we can use the mutate() and case_when() functions and piping to create an ordinal variable that captures different age groups:\n\n\nCode\ndf <- df %>% \n  mutate(AgeGroups = case_when(\n    Age<=13 ~ \"a. Less than or equal to 13\",\n    Age==14 | Age==15 ~ \"b. 14 or 15\", \n    Age==16 | Age==17 ~ \"c. 16 or 17\",\n    Age>=18 ~ \"d. Greater than or equal to 18\"))\n\n\nWith this new variable we can more easily compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. The following tables show the mean lung capacity for study subjects arranged by age group, first for those who reported not smoking and second for those who did report smoking:\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfilter(df, Smoke==\"no\") %>% \n  group_by(AgeGroups) %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean_LungCap\"=mean(LungCap)) %>% \n  arrange(AgeGroups)\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  AgeGroups                      Mean_LungCap\n  <chr>                                 <dbl>\n1 a. Less than or equal to 13            6.36\n2 b. 14 or 15                            9.14\n3 c. 16 or 17                           10.5 \n4 d. Greater than or equal to 18        11.1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfilter(df, Smoke==\"yes\") %>% \n  group_by(AgeGroups) %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean_LungCap\"=mean(LungCap)) %>% \n  arrange(AgeGroups)\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  AgeGroups                      Mean_LungCap\n  <chr>                                 <dbl>\n1 a. Less than or equal to 13            7.20\n2 b. 14 or 15                            8.39\n3 c. 16 or 17                            9.38\n4 d. Greater than or equal to 18        10.5 \n\n\nThis data shows that lung capacity generally increases with age.\nIt is interesting to note that on average all age groups that did not smoke had a higher lung capacity except for those who were 13 or under. The group found to have the lowest lung capacity in the whole dataset were children 13 or under who did not smoke.\nSince the finding related to this age group (study subjects aged 13 or under) was unexpected, I used the filter() and table() functions to examine the sample size of this group.\n\n\nCode\nThirteen_and_under <- filter(df, AgeGroups == \"a. Less than or equal to 13\")\ntable(Thirteen_and_under$Smoke)\n\n\n\n no yes \n401  27 \n\n\nAccording to this data, there were only 27 children in this study 13 years old or under who reported smoking. In order to better understand the relationship between age, smoking status and lung capacity we could run another study with a larger sample size."

That is, the lung caps grow with age. Here, it is possible to infer why the lung caps of smokers and non-smokers presented in this data are different from our common sense. The more adults there are, the more smokers there will be, and that may have led to a larger lung cap for smokers.\n##e\nFirst, let’s look at the children’s group.\n\n\nCode\nchilddf<-filter(df, cAge==\"Child\")\ntable(childdf$Smoke)\n\n\n\n no yes \n401  27 \n\n\nCode\nchilddf%>%group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>           <dbl>\n1 no               6.36\n2 yes              7.20\n\n\nSmokers have bigger lung cap.

In other words, when looking at the entire child group, the growth of natural lung caps with growth is not well revealed, so smokers’ lung caps seem to be larger.\nNext, let’s look at the middle group.\n\n\nCode\nmiddf<-filter(df, cAge==\"Middle\")\ntable(middf$Smoke)\n\n\n\n no yes \n105  15 \n\n\nCode\nmiddf%>%group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>           <dbl>\n1 no               9.14\n2 yes              8.39\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap~Smoke, middf)\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-smokers of middle group seem to have bigger lung caps.\nThen, let’s look at the high group.\n\n\nCode\nhighdf<-filter(df, cAge==\"High\")\ntable(highdf$Smoke)\n\n\n\n no yes \n 77  20 \n\n\nCode\nhighdf%>%group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>           <dbl>\n1 no              10.5 \n2 yes              9.38\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap~Smoke, highdf)\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-smokers of high group also have bigger lung caps.\nLastly, let me check the adult group.\n\n\nCode\nadultdf<-filter(df, cAge==\"Adult\")\ntable(adultdf$Smoke)\n\n\n\n no yes \n 65  15 \n\n\nCode\nadultdf%>%group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise(mean(LungCap))\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke `mean(LungCap)`\n  <chr>           <dbl>\n1 no               11.1\n2 yes              10.5\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(LungCap~Smoke, adultdf)\n\n\n\n\n\nEven in the adult group, non-smokers have a bigger lung cap.\nFinally, I took a look at the overall plot.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(df, aes(x=Age, y=LungCap)) +\n  geom_point(aes(col=factor(Smoke)))\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, it seems that the lung cap of non-smokers (red) is higher than that of smokers (blue)."

    "text": "First, let’s read in the data from the Excel file:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\ndf <- read_excel(\"_data/LungCapData.xls\")\n\n\nThe distribution of LungCap looks as follows:\n\n\nCode\nhist(df$LungCap)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram suggests that the distribution is close to a normal distribution. Most of the observations are close to the mean. Very few observations are close to the margins (0 and 15).\n##b\nTo compare the distribution of the Lung Capacity with respect to Male & Females, I used ggplot to create a side by side boxplot of Lung Capacity for female and males in the sample, with female lung capacity in red & male lung capacity in blue.\n\n\nCode\n#load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nggplot(data = df, aes(x= Gender, y = LungCap, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16)) +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot - Lung Capacity by Gender\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Lung Capacity (L)\") \n\n\n\n\n\nThe box-plot above shows that males in the sample had on average a higher lung capacity than female in the sample, with a higher minimum, Q1, median, Q3, & maximum lung capacity. 50% of the lung capacity of females in the sample was between 5.75 L - 9.25 L with a median lung capacity of ~7.75 L. In contrast, 50% of the lung capacity of males in the sample was between 6.5L - 10.5L with a median lung capacity of ~8.25L.\nFrom the size of the boxes & whiskers, it seems that a good amount of the male & female lung capacity is clustered around the median, but to better visualize the distribution, not just the difference between male females, I created a histogram below facet-wrapped by gender.\n\n\nCode\n##Histogram\nggplot(df, aes(x= LungCap, fill = Gender)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(vars(`Gender`)) + labs(title = \"Histogram - Lung Capacity by Gender\", x = \"Lung Capacity (L)\", y = \"Frequency\") \n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram also reflects a higher lung capacity for men in the sample than women as seen on the x-axis. It also shows that the lung capacity is somewhat normally distributed overall with most of the observations near the mean, though there are several peaks & dips in the histogram where a fewer or more individuals have a specific lung capacity than would be seen in a normal distribution. Additionally, the histogram for female lung capacity has more data concentrated around the mean, making it taller & pointier than the male lung capacity distribution. The male lung capacity histogram on the right has two modes (seen as peaks) at 7L & 11L on the left & right of the mean, unlike in a true normal distribution.\n##c\nTo compare the mean lung capacity of smokers to non-smokers in the sample, I used the group_by(), select(), & summarize() functions to get a table of the mean lung capacity in L for smokers vs. non-smokers in the sample.\n\n\nCode\n#Mean smokers vs. non-smokers.\n\ndf %>%\n  group_by(`Smoke`) %>%\n  select(`Smoke`, `LungCap`) %>%\n  summarize_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke LungCap\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 no       7.77\n2 yes      8.65\n\n\nThe mean lung capacity of smokers (Smoke = yes) was 8.65 L compared to a mean lung capacity of 7.77 L for non-smokers (Smoke = no).\nI was not expecting the mean Lung Capacity for smokers in this sample to be higher r than the mean Lung Capacity for non-smokers in the sample. This is because smoking harms lungs & thus is expected to decrease lung capacity.\nHowever, I anticipate that other factors such as age & gender might contribute to this counter-intuitive finding. For example, we saw in the previous question that males in the sample have a higher lung capacity then females. So if more smokers are male, the difference in lung capacity between smokers & non-smokers might be explained by gender more than smoking status.\n##d\nTo examine the relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity within age groups: “less than or equal to 13”, “14 to 15”, “16 to 17”, and “greater than or equal to 18”, I used the case_when() to recreate a new Age_Range variable corresponding to these age groups.\n\n\nCode\n##Using Case_When to create age_range variable\ndf_by_age <- df %>%\n  mutate(Age_Range = case_when(\n    Age <= 13 ~ \"13 or younger\",\n    Age >= 14 & Age < 16 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n    Age >= 15 & Age < 18 ~ \"16 to 17\",\n    Age >= 16 ~ \"18 or older\")\n)\n\n\nI first wanted to see the relative age of the sample. As seen in the table below, over half the sample is 13 or younger (484), with the least common age group in thh sample being 18 or older (80).\n\n\nCode\n#Counts by age\ntable(select(df_by_age, Age_Range))\n\n\nAge_Range\n13 or younger      14 to 15      16 to 17   18 or older \n          428           120            97            80 \n\n\nThis got me curious, as I don’t know many 13-year-olds or people younger than 13 who smoke. The below table shows for each age range how many people smoke vs not smoke. While 27 individuals who were 13 or younger in the sample smoked, this is dwarfed by the 401 13-year-old or younger individuals who don’t smoke. While the number of 13 or younger individuals who smoke is higher than the number of 18 or older individuals who smoke (27 vs. 15), relative to the entire age-group a much higher proportion of the 18 or older age group smoked (15/80) than in the 13 or younger group (27/428).\n\n\nCode\n#Counts yes or no smoking by age\ntable(select(df_by_age, Age_Range, Smoke))\n\n\n               Smoke\nAge_Range        no yes\n  13 or younger 401  27\n  14 to 15      105  15\n  16 to 17       77  20\n  18 or older    65  15\n\n\nAfter examining the relationship between age & smoking, I then wanted to examine the relationship between age & lung capacity before factoring in smoking status. I would expect that as you go through puberty and become and adult (18+) your lung capacity with increase from before puberty (13 and younger). The table below using group_by(), select(), & summarize_all() follows this expected trend, with mean lung capacity increasing for each age group from 6.41 L for 13 or younger to 10.96 L for 18+ individuals in the sample. The mean lung capacity of 18+ is only slightly higher than the mean lung capacity at 16-17 years-old.\n\n\nCode\n#Mean lung capacity by age group\ndf_by_age %>%\n  group_by(`Age_Range`) %>%\n  select(`Age_Range`, `LungCap`) %>%\n  summarise_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  Age_Range     LungCap\n  <chr>           <dbl>\n1 13 or younger    6.41\n2 14 to 15         9.05\n3 16 to 17        10.2 \n4 18 or older     11.0 \n\n\nFinally, I once again used the group_by(), select(), and summarise_all() function, grouping by age_range & smoking status & calculating the mean lung capacity for smokers & non smokers in each age range, which I will interpret in 1e.\n\n\nCode\n##Mean lung cap by age_range smoker vs. non-smoker\ndf_by_age %>%\n  group_by(`Smoke`, `Age_Range`) %>%\n  select(`Age_Range`, `LungCap`, `Smoke`) %>%\n  summarise_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n# Groups:   Smoke [2]\n  Smoke Age_Range     LungCap\n  <chr> <chr>           <dbl>\n1 no    13 or younger    6.36\n2 no    14 to 15         9.14\n3 no    16 to 17        10.5 \n4 no    18 or older     11.1 \n5 yes   13 or younger    7.20\n6 yes   14 to 15         8.39\n7 yes   16 to 17         9.38\n8 yes   18 or older     10.5 \n\n\n##e In contrast to 1c, where smokers had a higher mean lung capacity than non-smokers (8.64 L vs 7.77 L), for every age group except for 13 or younger non-smokers had a higher lung capacity than non-smokers.\n\nFor the 13 or younger: non-smoker lung capacity = 6.36L, smoker lung capacity = 7.20 L\nFor 14-15: non-smoker lung capacity = 9.14 L, smoker lung capacity = 8.39 L\nFor 16-17: non-smoker lung capacity = 10.47 L, smoker lung capacity = 9.38 L\nFor 18+: non-smoker lung capacity = 11.07L, smoker lung capacity = 10.51 L\n\nConsidering that in part d it was found that average lung capacity increases with age & that a smaller proportion of younger individuals in the sample smoked than the older students, one possible explanation for the finding in 1c is that the higher mean lung capacity for smokers overall in the sample could be due to a higher age of smokers in the sample, not due to smoking.\nIt is worth noting also that the sample smoking & nonsmoking mean lung capacity are closer to the mean lung capacity of the 13 & younger & 14-15 year old age groups, reflecting the larger number of younger folks in the sample compare.\nFor fun, I calculated the mean age for smokers & non smokers in the sample, and smokers indeed were older with a mean age of 14.8, compared to a mean non-smoker age of 12.03.\n\n\nCode\n#Mean age smoker vs. non-smoker\ndf %>%\n  group_by(`Smoke`) %>%\n  select(`Smoke`, `Age`) %>%\n  summarise_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Smoke   Age\n  <chr> <dbl>\n1 no     12.0\n2 yes    14.8\n\n\n#Question 2\n##a\nTo answer these questions I used R more of a calculator, plugging in the frequencies from the HW1 Prior Convictions frequency table to probability equations we learned in class.\nThe probability that a randomly selected inmate has exactly 2 prior convictions is the P(X=2) which is 0.198.\n\n\nCode\n#Calculating P(X=2)\nprob_2_pc = 160/810\nprob_2_pc\n\n\n[1] 0.1975309\n\n\n##b\nThe probability that a randomly selected inmate has fewer than 2 prior convictions is the P(X < 2) which is equal to the P(X=0 or 1) which is equal to P(X=0) + P(X=1) which equals a probability of 0.694.\n\n\nCode\n#Calculating P(X<2)\nprob_0_pc = 128/810\nprob_1_pc = 434/810\nprob_less_2_pc = prob_0_pc + prob_1_pc\nprob_less_2_pc\n\n\n[1] 0.6938272\n\n\n##c\nThe probability that a randomly selected inmate has 2 or fewer prior convictions is the P(X ≤ 2) which is equal to the P(X=0 or 1 or 2) which is equal to P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) which equals a probability of 0.891.\n\n\nCode\n#Calculating P(X≤2)\n\nprob_0_pc = 128/810\nprob_1_pc = 434/810\nprob_2_pc = 160/810\nprob_equal_or_less_2pc = prob_0_pc + prob_1_pc + prob_2_pc\nprob_equal_or_less_2pc\n\n\n[1] 0.891358\n\n\n##d The probability that a randomly selected inmate has greater than 2 prior convictions is the P(X >2) which is equal to the P(X=3 or 4) which is equal to P(X=3) + P(X=4), which gives a probability of 0.109.\nBecause probabilities should be cumulative, the probability of having greater than 2 prior convictions & the probability of having 2 or less prior convictions should add up to 1.

All LungCaps are higher for non-smokers with the exception of those in the 13-and-under age bracket. It would make sense that non-smokers would have higher lung capacities, though it is interesting that the value is lower for the youngest age group. This does, however, correlate with the results to question 1c, which indicated that smokers have higher lung capacities than non-smokers; there could, perhaps, be other extenuating circumstances contributing to these lower rates of capacity, such as health issues, development, or exposure.\n\n\nQuestion 2a: What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has exactly 2 prior convictions?\n\n\nCode\ninmate <- c(128, 434, 160, 64, 24)\nmean(inmate)\n\n\n[1] 162\n\n\nCode\nsd(inmate)\n\n\n[1] 161.0838\n\n\nCode\n# mean=162\n# sd=161.1\n\nconvictions <- c(0:4)\n\ndata <- tibble(inmate, convictions)\n\ntwo <- 160/summarise(data, sum(inmate))\n  two\n\n\n  sum(inmate)\n1   0.1975309\n\n\nHere, we can see that the probability of an inmate having exactly two prior convictions is 19.8%.\n\n\nQuestion 2b: What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has fewer than 2 prior convictions?\n\n\nCode\nfewer_than_two <- 128 + 434\nfewer_than_two/summarise(data, sum(inmate))\n\n\n  sum(inmate)\n1   0.6938272\n\n\nHere, we can see that the probability of a randomly selected inmate having fewer than two prior convictions is 69.4%.\n\n\nQuestion 2c: What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has 2 or fewer prior convictions?\n\n\nCode\ntwo_or_fewer <- 128 + 434 + 160\ntwo_or_fewer/summarise(data, sum(inmate))\n\n\n  sum(inmate)\n1    0.891358\n\n\nHere, we can see that the probability of a randomly selected inmate having two or fewer prior convictions is 89.1%.\n\n\nQuestion 2d: What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has more than 2 prior convictions?\n\n\nCode\nmore_than_two <- 160 + 64 + 24\nmore_than_two/summarise(data, sum(inmate))\n\n\n  sum(inmate)\n1   0.3061728\n\n\nHere, we can see that the probability of a randomly selected inmate having more than two prior convictions is 30.6%.\n\n\nQuestion 2e: What is the expected value1 for the number of prior convictions?\n\n\nCode\ndata_prob <- transform(data, probability = (inmate/810))\ndata_ev <- transform(data_prob, x = convictions*probability)\n\nEV <- sum(data_ev$x)\nEV\n\n\n[1] 1.28642\n\n\nThe expected value1 for the number of prior convictions is 1.3.\n\n\nQuestion 2f: Calculate the variance and the standard deviation for the Prior Convictions.\n\n\nCode\ninmate <- c(128, 434, 160, 64, 24)\nvar(inmate)\n\n\n[1] 25948\n\n\nCode\nsd(inmate)\n\n\n[1] 161.0838\n\n\nThe variance for the prior convictions is 25948, while the standard deviation is 161."

For male, the median line is slightly higher than female, suggesting that their average lungCap is slightly higher for males than females. Also, for male the median is directly in the middle, suggesting that the data isn’t particularly skewed. For female the split appears to have more values fall below the mean than above, telling us that the data skews moreso than for male.\n\nCompare the mean lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers.

Here, the lung capacity for non-smokers is higher than the lung capacity for smokers in youngest age range, but the other age ranges display the opposite relationship. This may be due to the possibility that smoking has a stronger influence on lungCapacity the longer you smoke. So younger folks may have only smoked for a year or so, while folks in the older age ranges have spent many more years smoking.

Does it make sense?\n\n\nCode\ndf %>%\n  group_by(Smoke) %>%\n  summarise(mean = mean(LungCap), n = n())\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  Smoke  mean     n\n  <chr> <dbl> <int>\n1 no     7.77   648\n2 yes    8.65    77\n\n\nSmokers have a mean lung capacity of 8.65, versus non-smokers who have a lung capacity of 7.77. These results do not make sense, as we would expect non-smokers to have greater lung capacity.\n\n\n\nExamine the relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity within age groups: “less than or equal to 13”, “14 to 15”, “16 to 17”, and “greater than or equal to 18”.\n\n\nCode\nage_groups <- df %>% \n  mutate(\n    # Create categories\n    AgeGroup = case_when(\n      Age <= 13            ~ \"0 to 13\",\n      Age == 14 | Age == 15 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n      Age == 16 | Age == 17 ~ \"16 to 17\",\n      Age >= 18             ~ \"18 and above\"\n    ),\n    # Convert to factor\n    AgeGroup = factor(\n      AgeGroup,\n      level = c(\"0 to 13\", \"14 to 15\",\"16 to 17\", \"18 and above\")\n    )\n  )\n\nboxplot(LungCap~AgeGroup, data=age_groups)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot suggests that the greater the age, the greater the lung capacity. This is especially evident when comparing the lowest age group (0-13) versus the rest of them, but between the two oldest age groups (16-17 vs 18+), this is the least evident. This makes sense as the greatest physical growth usually happens earlier in life - from childhood to puberty - but then this slows down in the late teens and it almost entirely stops during young adulthood.\n\n\n\nCompare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. Is your answer different from the one in part c. What could possibly be going on here?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nage_groups %>% ggplot(aes(x=AgeGroup, y=LungCap, fill=Smoke)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer is different than what I found in 1.C. I previously found that the lung capacity mean for non-smokers was less than the smoking counterpart; however, this new box plot suggests that most non-smoking age groups actually have better lung capacity than smokers. The only age group where this condition isn’t met is in the youngest ages (0-13) so it is likely that this group that is skewing the overall smoker versus non-smoker analysis."
