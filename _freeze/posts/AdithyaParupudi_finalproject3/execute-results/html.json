It contains records of various factors such as maternal age, weight, race, smoking habits during pregnancy, and the number of prenatal visits, among others. By analyzing the relationships between these variables and birth weight, researchers and medical professionals can identify potential risk factors, better understand the determinants of low birth weight, and develop effective interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.\n\n# Research Questions\n\n1.  What is the relationship between history of hypertension (ht) and risk of low infant birth weight (low) after controlling for the interaction between uterine irritability(ui) and the number of previous premature labors(ptl)?\n\n2.  How maternal smoking during pregnancy and racial differences influence newborn birth weight, and how it varies over different age groups?\n\n# Hypothesis\n\n-   For research question 1 - A history of hypertension (ht) is positively associated with an increased risk of low infant birth weight (low) along with uterine irritability (ui) and the number of previous premature labors (ptl)\n\n-   For research question 2 - A history of maternal smoking(smoke) during pregnancy and a mother's race(race) is positively associated with an increased newborn birth weight(low).\n\n# Descriptive Statistics\n\nThe birthwt data frame has 189 rows and 10 columns. The data were collected at Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, Mass during 1986.\n\n-   low: an indicator of birth weight less than 2.5 kg.\n-   age: mother's age in years.\n-   lwt: mother's weight in pounds at last menstrual period.\n-   race: mother's race (1 = white, 2 = black, 3 = other).\n-   smoke: smoking status during pregnancy.\n-   ptl: number of previous premature labors.\n-   ht: history of hypertension.\n-   ui: presence of uterine irritability.\n-   ftv: number of physician visits during the first trimester.\n-   bwt: birth weight in grams.\n\n# Facorising the dataset\n\nSome columns in the dataset are categorical but still are shown as integers. So converting them to factors and defining levels to columns wherever applicable. Here, age and lwt are continuous, but for analysis purposes, I've categorised them into ordinal categories.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirthwt_new = birthwt\n# converting birthwt to

The histogram roughly looks like a bell-curve with a peak from 2500-3500 grams. There are fewer cases of low birth weight in bwt less than 2000 grams and greater than 4000 grams. The majority count is between weight ranges of 2500-2500 grams.

This suggests that pregnant mothers who smoke are at an increased risk of having infants with low birth weight compared to non-smokers.\n\nRegarding the mother's age, the coefficients for age.L (-8.6511), age.Q (-6.1372), and age.C (-2.1288) represent the associations with different age levels. However, none of these coefficients are statistically significant, indicating that the mother's age, as captured in this model, does not significantly impact the log-odds of low birth weight.\n\nOn the other hand, the coefficient for raceblack (1.0951) indicates a statistically significant positive association between being of black race and the log-odds of low birth weight. Similarly, the coefficient for raceother (1.0425) suggests a statistically significant positive association with being of another race.

A straight line in the Q-Q plot means that the observed residuals closely match the expected quantiles of a normal distribution.\n\n-   Scale-Location: There is one observation at the top of the scale-location plot while the rest of the observations align along a straight line, it suggests the presence of an influential outlier. An influential outlier is an observation that has a significant impact on the regression model, affecting the estimated coefficients and overall model fit.\n\n-   Residuals vs Leverage: Looks like there are one outlier observation. But it dont appear to be influential.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(model11)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](AdithyaParupudi_finalproject3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](AdithyaParupudi_finalproject3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](AdithyaParupudi_finalproject3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](AdithyaParupudi_finalproject3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plotting Model 2\n\nFrom the plots we can conclude that:\n\n-   Residuals vs Fitted: A straight line pattern here indicates that the residuals have a constant variance across the range of predicted values, which is indicative of a good fit\n\n-   Normal Q-Q: The plot closely follow the diagonal line, it indicates that the residuals are normally distributed\n\n-   Scale-Location: Looks like there is heteroscedasticity.\n\n-   Residuals vs Leverage: Looks like there are one or two outlier observations.

Furthermore, taking into account the interaction with uterine irritability, the chance of low birth weight is highest when the mother has experienced 0 to 2 prior premature labors. These results are consistent with our original theory.\n\n-   Our study brings us to draw the conclusion that maternal smoking during pregnancy marginally increases the likelihood of a kid having a low birth weight. Compared to mothers of other races, this effect is slightly stronger for mothers of the black race. Low birth weight is more likely in moms under the age of 30, but it is not significantly different in mothers beyond the age of 40. These results corroborate our hypothesis that there is a link between mother smoking, being black, and a higher risk of having a baby that is underweight.\n\n# Future Scope\n\nIn future analysis, I want to incorporate additional factors such as parental education level, environmental exposure to pollutants, or access to prenatal care, and observe their impact on birth weight.\n\n# References\n\nVenables, W.
