The dataset contains survey responses from almost 24,000 respondents from varying backgrounds. The survey contains 50 questions, including 9 demographic questions and 41 questions around machine learning and data science. The questions range from platforms and products used, and tools and methodology, barriers to entry, and more. It also asks respondents about their employee experience working in these fields. I believe that the wide array of types of questions used make this dataset a good fit for research, as there are binary and categorical variables to explore but also some that ask for explicit numeric values like what percentage of their work falls to different tasks. Having several different types of questions provide opportunities for multiple types of models to be performed.\n\nThis survey was also run in 2017, 2019, and 2020 on Kaggle as part of an annual competition where users could submit code and analysis using this public data. However, I decided to use the 2018 dataset as my focus because certain questions that I think would be really interesting to analyze were omitted in later years/the survey was shortened overall. This survey was hosted by Kaggle, open to anyone in the industry, for one week in October 2018.\n\n\nReading in the dataset --\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfinal <- read_csv(\"_data/final_project_data.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, see `problems()` for details\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 23304 Columns: 406\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (346): Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q7_RCSTUD, Q7_RCTECH, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q1...\ndbl  (56): Time from Start to Finish (seconds), Q1_OTHER_TEXT, Q6_OTHER_TEXT...\nlgl   (4): Q28_Part_22, Q29_Part_16, Q38_Part_19, Q38_Part_20\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfinalnew <- read_csv(\"_data/final_project_data 3.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 23304 Columns: 403\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (348): Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q7_RCSTUD, Q7_RCTECH, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q1...\ndbl  (53): Time from Start to Finish (seconds), Q1_OTHER_TEXT, Q6_OTHER_TEXT...\nlgl   (2): Q38_Part_19, Q38_Part_20\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfinalf <- read_csv(\"_data/final_project_data 3.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 23304 Columns: 403\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (348): Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q7_RCSTUD, Q7_RCTECH, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q1...\ndbl  (53): Time from Start to Finish (seconds), Q1_OTHER_TEXT, Q6_OTHER_TEXT...\nlgl   (2): Q38_Part_19, Q38_Part_20\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(final,10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 406\n   Time from…¹ Q1    Q1_OT…² Q2    Q3    Q4    Q5    Q6    Q6_OT…³ Q7    Q7_RC…⁴\n         <dbl> <chr>   <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <dbl> <chr> <chr>  \n 1         959 Male       -1 35-39 Chile Doct… Info… Other       1 Acad… Non-st…\n 2        1512 Male       -1 18-21 India Bach… Comp… Stud…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n 3         848 Male       -1 22-24 Denm… Bach… Engi… Stud…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n 4        2309 Male       -1 30-34 China Doct… Other Rese…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n 5        1487 Male       -1 18-21 China Bach… Comp… Stud…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n 6         790 Male       -1 25-29 China Mast… Engi… Stud…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n 7        2986 Male       -1 40-44 India Doct… Comp… Other       7 Acad… Non-st…\n 8        1255 Male       -1 18-21 India Some… Engi… Stud…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n 9         825 Male       -1 25-29 India Bach… Comp… Data…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n10        1315 Male       -1 18-21 India Bach… Engi… Stud…      -1 Acad… Non-st…\n# … with 395 more variables: Q7_RCSTUDY <dbl>, Q7_RCSTUDN <dbl>,\n#   Q7_RCSTUD2 <dbl>, Q7_RCTECH <chr>, Q7_RCTECH2 <dbl>, Q7_OTHER_TEXT <dbl>,\n#   Q8 <chr>, Q8RC <dbl>, Q9 <chr>, Q10 <chr>, Q11_Part_1 <chr>,\n#   Q11_Part_2 <chr>, Q11_Part_3 <chr>, Q11_Part_4 <chr>, Q11_Part_5 <chr>,\n#   Q11_Part_6 <chr>, Q11_Part_7 <chr>, Q11_OTHER_TEXT <dbl>,\n#   Q12_MULTIPLE_CHOICE <chr>, Q12_Part_1_TEXT <dbl>, Q12_Part_2_TEXT <dbl>,\n#   Q12_Part_3_TEXT <dbl>, Q12_Part_4_TEXT <dbl>, Q12_Part_5_TEXT <dbl>, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Research Question \n\nUpon doing a cursory search around this data, I see some high level executive-summary style research published about this data set, but I wasn't able to find anything focused on more specific research questions. It was more demographic data of the state of ML and Data Science. I think there is the opportunity to speak more specifically about the state of machine learning and data science, and look deeper at what tools students and employees are using versus what their time is devoted to.\n\nTherefore, my main research questions are:\n\n1) \"What tools are being used in the context of individuals school and work?\"\n2) \"How does an individual's background (age, career, education, etc.) impact how they navigate this tech world?\"\n\nI plan to use questions like \"During a typical data science project at work or school, approximately what proportion of your time is devoted to the following?\" or \"What percentage of your current machine learning/data science training falls under each category?\" to get exact numbers that I can correlate against demos and more general usage of tools and platforms to see if there is any connection between the work one does and the tools they use.\n\nI am interested in this dataset because a lot of research in my career is in the machine learning space, so I am always interested in contextualizing the employee experience in these areas so that I can better understand the subject of some of my survey research. I also do more general employee engagement research in my career and I think this final is a great opportunity to try my hand at some of the correlations I would like to run at my job now but have never been able to because I don't have any prior stats knowledge.\n\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nThe two hypotheses I would like to test are as follows:\n\n1) Students are more likely to use free course and certification platforms as opposed to employees who may opt for a paid course or certification through their employer. \n2) Older or more experienced data scientists tend to spent more time on the analysis end of the process.\n\nI will explore the results of the survey questions in conjunction with demographics in this dataset like age, education, industry, years of experience, etc.to test my hypotheses.\n\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\nI described my dataset at the top of this as well as discussed variables of interest in the Research Question section, but here is a little bit of exploratory code:\n \n\n \nI can see the data contains mostly younger males, but because of the sample size can really work with lots of demographic combinations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(finalf, aes(x = Q1)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n   labs(x=\"Gender\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](abigailbalint_finalpart2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(final, aes(x = Q2)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x=\"Age\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](abigailbalint_finalpart2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is also a range of coding experience in the dataset.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(final, aes(x = Q24)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n   labs(x=\"Years of coding experience\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](abigailbalint_finalpart2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nThe data is split between students, tech industry employees, and other industry employees.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(final, aes(x = Q7)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n   labs(x=\"Industry\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](abigailbalint_finalpart2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nHere, I made a scatterplot showing where the amount of training from work meets the amount of time spent finding insights instead of cleaning data, coding, etc. I expected this to be much higher for those who received most or all of their training from work, but that isn't the case.
