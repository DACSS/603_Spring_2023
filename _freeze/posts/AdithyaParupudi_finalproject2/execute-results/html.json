It contains records of various factors such as maternal age, weight, race, smoking habits during pregnancy, and the number of prenatal visits, among others. By analyzing the relationships between these variables and birth weight, researchers and medical professionals can identify potential risk factors, better understand the determinants of low birth weight, and develop effective interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.\n\n# Research Questions\n\n1.  What is the relationship between history of hypertension (ht) and risk of low infant birth weight (low) after controlling for the interaction between uterine irritability(ui) and the number of previous premature labors(ptl)?\n\n2.  How maternal smoking during pregnancy and racial differences influence newborn birth weight?\n\n# Hypothesis\n\n-   For research question 1\n\n    -   **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no relationship between history of hypertension (ht) and risk of low infant birth weight (low) after controlling for the interaction between uterine irritability (ui) and the number of previous premature labors (ptl).\n\n    -   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a relationship between history of hypertension (ht) and risk of low infant birth weight (low) after controlling for the interaction between uterine irritability (ui) and the number of previous premature labors (ptl).\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- -->\n```\n\n-   For research question 2\n\n    -   For maternal smoking:\n\n        -   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and newborn birth weight.\n\n        -   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy and newborn birth weight.\n\n    -   For racial differences:\n\n        -   **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no relationship between racial differences and newborn birth weight.\n\n        -   **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** There is a relationship between racial differences and newborn birth weight.\n\n# Descriptive Statistics\n\nThe birthwt data frame has 189 rows and 10 columns.

Each point represents a single data point from the 'birthwt' dataset. From the plot, we can visually assess if there is any trend or pattern between the mother's age and the birth weight of the baby.\n\nIt is known that birthwt greater than 2500 grams is considered healthy weight. In the below scatterplot, we can observe that there are many cases of low birth weight registered in mothers who are aged between 20 and 30, with fewer such cases reported in mothers aged less than 20. As the mother's age increased, there are fewer cases of low birthwt weight.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(birthwt, aes(x = age, y = bwt)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter plot of Mother's Age vs Birth Weight\",\n       x = \"Mother's Age\",\n       y = \"Birth Weight (grams)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](AdithyaParupudi_finalproject2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Histogram of Birth Weight\n\nThis plot is a histogram of the birth weights (x-axis) in the dataset, showing the frequency (y-axis) of the birth weights within specific intervals (bins). The histogram roughly looks like a bell-curve with a peak from 2500-3500 grams. There are fewer cases of low birth weight in bwt less than 2000 grams and greater than 4000 grams. The majority count is between weight ranges of 2500-2500 grams.

Non-smokers are represented by dark green points, while smokers are represented by red points. This plot enables us to visually compare the birth weight patterns between smokers and non-smokers across different ages of mothers.\n\nFrom the scatter plot it can be noted that there are many points in age groups '\\<20' and '20-30', with no smokers above 40 years. It looks like the number of smokers and non-smokers belonging to age group 20-30 are almost equal.

The highest birthweight of \\~5000grams is observed in white mothers, followed by \\~4000 grams in other race mothers, with the black mothers having their child's birthwt just below 4000 grams.

Both main effects of having a history of hypertension and uterine irritability are significantly associated with low birth weight. The interaction term is not defined, which could be due to collinearity or insufficient data. However, the significant main effects suggest that both hypertension and uterine irritability are important predictors of low birth weight in this model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel3 <- glm(low ~ ht * ui, data = birthwt, family = binomial)\nsummary(model3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = low ~ ht * ui, family = binomial, data = birthwt)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  \n-1.3232  -0.7673  -0.7673   1.1774   1.6531  \n\nCoefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)\n            Estimate Std.
