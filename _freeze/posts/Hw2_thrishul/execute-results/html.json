The time between the date a patient was recommended for heart surgery and the surgery date\nfor cardiac patients in Ontario was collected by the Cardiac Care Network (“Wait Times Data\nGuide,” Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario, Canada, 2006). The sample mean\nand sample standard deviation for wait times (in days) of patients for two cardiac procedures\nare given in the accompanying table. Assume that the sample is representative of the Ontario\npopulation\n\n        Surgical Procedure Sample Size Mean Wait Time Standard Deviation\nBypass     539            19                10\nAngiography 847           18                9\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# To construct a confidence interval for the mean wait time for each procedure, we will use the following formula:\n\n# CI = x̄ ± zα/2 * (σ/√n)\n# For bypass surgery:\n# x̄ = 19\n# σ = 10\n# n = 539\n# zα/2 = 1.645\n\n# CI = 19 ± 1.645 * (10/√539) = (17.8, 20.2)\n\n# For angiography:\n# x̄ = 18\n# σ = 9\n# n = 847\n# zα/2 = 1.645\n\n# CI = 18 ± 1.645 * (9/√847) = (17.2, 18.8)\n\n# The confidence interval for bypass surgery is (17.8, 20.2) and the confidence interval for angiography is (17.2, 18.8). We can see that the confidence interval for angiography is narrower, which means that we are more certain about the mean wait time for angiography than for bypass surgery.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\nA survey of 1031 adult Americans was carried out by the National Center for Public Policy. Assume that the sample is representative of adult Americans. Among those surveyed, 567 believed that college education is essential for success. Find the point estimate, p, of the proportion of all adult Americans who believe that a college education is essential for success. Construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for p.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The point estimate, p, of the proportion of all adult Americans who believe that a college education is essential for success is:\n\n# p = 567/1031 = 0.5498\n\n# To construct a 95% confidence interval for p, we will use the following formula:\n\n# CI = p ± zα/2 * √(p(1-p)/n)\n\n# 95% corresponds to a z-score of 1.96\n\n# CI = 0.5498 ± 1.96 * √(0.5498(1-0.5498)/1031) = (0.517, 0.582)\n# The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of all adult Americans who believe that a college education is essential for success is (0.517, 0.582). This means that we can be 95% confident that the true proportion of all adult Americans who believe that a college education is essential for success falls within this interval. \n\n# We can interpret this as saying that, based on the sample data, we estimate that between 51.7% and 58.2% of all adult Americans believe that a college education is essential for success.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Question 3\nSuppose that the financial aid office of UMass Amherst seeks to estimate the mean cost of textbooks per semester for students. The estimate will be useful if it is within $5 of the true population mean (i.e. they want the confidence interval to have a length of $10 or less). The financial aid office is pretty sure that the amount spent on books varies widely, with most values between $30 and $200. They think that the population standard deviation is about a quarter of this range (in other words, you can assume they know the population standard deviation). Assuming the significance level to be 5%, what should be the size of the sample?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# margin of error formula\n## ME = z * (sigma / sqrt(n))\n### solving for n\n#### n = (z * sigma/ME)^2\n##### replacing values\n###### z = significance level 5% = critical z value for 95% conf int = 1.96\n###### sigma = 1/4 of range of textbook costs = (200-30)/4 = 42.5\n###### ME = estimate within 5 of the true population mean = 5\n\n# calculate result\nn <- round((1.96*42.5/5)^2)\n\n# print result\ncat(\"Ideal sample size:\", n, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nIdeal sample size: 278 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing the margin of error formula for confidence intervals and solving for n (sample size), we see that the ideal sample size (rounded to the nearest integer) is 278.\n\n## Question 4\nAccording to a union agreement, the mean income for all senior-level workers in a large service company equals $500 per week. A representative of a women’s group decides to analyze whether the mean income μ for female employees matches this norm. For a random sample of nine female employees, ȳ = $410 and s = 90.\n\n\nTest whether the mean income of female employees differs from $500 per week. Include assumptions, hypotheses, test statistic, and P-value. Interpret the result.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nThe data is normally distributed.\n\nThe sample is a simple random sample.\n\nThe standard deviation of the population is unknown.\n\nHypotheses:\n\nH0: μ = 500\n\nH1: Ha: μ ≠ 500\n\nTest statistic:\n\nt = (ȳ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n)) = (410 - 500) / (90 / sqrt(9)) = -3\nP-value:\n\nThe P-value is 0.01707168, which is less than the level of significance of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean income of female employees differs from $500 per week.\nReport the P-value for Ha: μ < 500. Interpret.\n\nThe P-value is 0.008535841, which is less than the level of significance of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean income of female employees is less than $500 per week.\nReport and interpret the P-value for Ha: μ > 500.\n\nThe P-value is 0.9914642, which is more than the level of significance of 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the mean income of female employees is greater than $500 per week.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# A.3.a.

Jones gets ȳ = 519.5, with se = 10.0. Smith gets ȳ = 519.7, with se = 10.0.\n\nShow that t = 1.95 and P-value = 0.051 for Jones. Show that t = 1.97 and P-value = 0.049 for Smith.\n\nJones:\n\nt = (ȳ - μ) / se = (519.5 - 500) / 10 = 19.5 / 10 = 1.95\n\nP-value = round(2 * pt(q=1.95, df=999, lower.tail=FALSE), 3) = 0.051\n\nSmith:\n\nt = (ȳ - μ) / se = (519.7 - 500) / 10 = 19.7 / 10 = 1.97\n\nP-value = round(2 * pt(q=1.97, df=999, lower.tail=FALSE), 3) = 0.049\n\nUsing α = 0.05, for each study indicate whether the result is “statistically significant.”\n\nSince Jones’ P-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that his results are not statistically significant. In contrast, Smith’s P-value is less than 0.05, therefore we reject the null hypothesis and find his results statistically significant.\nUsing this example, explain the misleading aspects of reporting the result of a test as “P ≤ 0.05” versus “P > 0.05,” or as “reject H0” versus “Do not reject H0,” without reporting the actual P-value.\n\n“P ≤ 0.05” or “reject H0” without reporting the actual P-value can be misleading because it doesn’t provide information on how strong the evidence is against the null hypothesis. For example, both Jones and Smith barely pass the 0.05 threshold, having 0.049 and 0.051, respectively. Reporting this would help readers and analysts to take the strength of the evidence in consideration (in this case, “rejecting H0” or “failing to reject H0” should be taken with a grain of salt).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# A.1.b.

She conducts a survey of 300 middle school students, with the results below. Test at α = 0.05 the claim that the proportion who choose a healthy snack differs by grade level. What is the null hypothesis? Which test should we use?
