The only thing that changes is the intercept, since we shift the x values to the left by converting their units. \n\n### b\n\nLikewise, the correlation does not change because we do not change the relationship by changing the unit of measurement.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit<- lm(log(fertility) ~ log(ppgdp), data = UN11)\nsummary(fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(fertility) ~ log(ppgdp), data = UN11)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.79828 -0.21639  0.02669  0.23424  0.95596 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

As religious participation increases, respondents move right on the political spectrum. This observed relationship is supported by our regression model. Compared to those who never attend church, and assuming the very liberal is the baseline, those who attend occasionally move 0.25 points to the right. Those who attend most weeks weeks are 2.16 points to the right on the political spectrum, and those who attend every week 2.6 points to the right from those who never attend church. However, occasionally is not statistically significant while most weeks and every week are statistically significant. The R-Squared metric shows us that religiosity explains about 39 percent of variation in political ideology. The entire model is statistically significant.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = student.survey, aes(x = re, y = pi)) + \n  geom_count()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](asch_harwood_hw3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nre_dummies <- model.matrix(~ re - 1, data = student.survey)\nre_dummies_df <- as.data.frame(re_dummies)\nre_pi_df <- cbind(student.survey, re_dummies_df)\ncolnames(re_pi_df) <- gsub(\" \", \"_\", colnames(re_pi_df))\npi_mapping <- c(\"very liberal\" = -3, \"liberal\" = -2, \"slightly liberal\" = -1, \"moderate\" = 0, \n                \"slightly conservative\" = 1, \"conservative\" = 2, \"very conservative\" = 3)\nre_pi_df$pi_numeric <- as.numeric(pi_mapping[as.character(re_pi_df$pi)])\nre_pi_df$re <- factor(re_pi_df$re, ordered = FALSE)\nre_pi_df$re <- relevel(factor(re_pi_df$re), ref = \"never\")\nfit <- lm(pi_numeric ~ re, data = re_pi_df)\nsummary(fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pi_numeric ~ re, data = re_pi_df)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.8889 -0.5172 -0.2667  1.2040  2.7333 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.

However, there appear to be a few outliers, which may be exerting undue influence. After dropping those outliers, a relationship seems less likely.
