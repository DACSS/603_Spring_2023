The data are for 199 localities, mostly UN member countries, but also other areas such as Hong Kong that are not independent countries. The data were collected from the United Nations (2011). We will study the dependence of fertility on ppgdp.*\n\n## a\n\n*Identify the predictor and the response.*\n\nFirst we'll load the data and take a look.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(UN11)\nglimpse(UN11)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 199\nColumns: 6\n$ region    <fct> Asia, Europe, Africa, Africa, Caribbean, Latin Amer, Asia, C…\n$ group     <fct> other, other, africa, africa, other, other, other, other, oe…\n$ fertility <dbl> 5.968, 1.525, 2.142, 5.135, 2.000, 2.172, 1.735, 1.671, 1.94…\n$ ppgdp     <dbl> 499.0, 3677.2, 4473.0, 4321.9, 13750.1, 9162.1, 3030.7, 2285…\n$ lifeExpF  <dbl> 49.49, 80.40, 75.00, 53.17, 81.10, 79.89, 77.33, 77.75, 84.2…\n$ pctUrban  <dbl> 23, 53, 67, 59, 100, 93, 64, 47, 89, 68, 52, 84, 89, 29, 45,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`Fertility` is the ***response*** variable and `ppgdp` is the ***predictor*** variable.\n\n## b\n\n*Draw the scatterplot of fertility on the vertical axis versus ppgdp on the horizontal axis and summarize the information in this graph.

Does the simple linear regression model seem plausible for a summary of this graph?

For a British version of the report on the analysis, all responses are converted to British pounds sterling (1 pound equals about 1.33 dollars, as of 2016).*\n\nFirst, let's create some data we can use to investigate the answers to these questions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create initial dataset\nx_US <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10)\ny <- 2 * x_US + rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 5)\ndf <- data.frame(x_US, y)\n\n# create additional variable that converts x variable into pounds sterling\ndf$x_UK <- df$x_US*(1/1.33)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## a\n\n*How, if at all, does the slope of the prediction equation change?*\n\nTo answer this question we'll run a linear regression for both x_US and y, and x_UK and y and compare the coefficients.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## US dollars\nLR_US <- lm(formula = y ~ x_US, data = df)\nsummary(LR_US)$coefficients\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            Estimate Std.

One factor affecting water availability is stream runoff. If runoff could be predicted, engineers, planners, and policy makers could do their jobs more efficiently. The data file contains 43 years' worth of precipitation measurements taken at six sites in the Sierra Nevada mountains (labeled APMAM, APSAB, APSLAKE, OPBPC, OPRC, and OPSLAKE) and stream runoff volume at a site near Bishop, California, labeled BSAAM. Draw the scatterplot matrix for these data and summarize the information available from these plots.*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npairs(water)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_JustineShakespeare_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks as thought the variable that captures stream runoff volume (BSAAM) correlates rather highly with the variables, OPBPC, OPRC, and OPSLAKE. In fact, it looks as though all of those variables have a strong linear and positive relationship with each other. \n\nWhile the relationship between BSAAM and the other sites (APMAM, APSAB, APSLAKE) does not appear to be strong, those sites all seem to have a positive linear relationship with each other. \n\nIt is worth noting the Years variable does not appear to have a meaningful relationship with the other variables.\n\n# Question 4\n\n*Professor ratings (Data file: Rateprof in alr4) In the website and online forum RateMyProfessors.com, students rate and comment on their instructors. Launched in 1999, the site includes millions of ratings on thousands of instructors. The data file includes the summaries of the ratings of 364 instructors at a large campus in the Midwest (Bleske-Rechek and Fritsch, 2011). Each instructor included in the data had at least 10 ratings over a several year period. Students provided ratings of 1--5 on quality, helpfulness, clarity, easiness of instructor's courses, and raterInterest in the subject matter covered in the instructor's courses. The data file provides the averages of these five ratings. Create a scatterplot matrix of these five variables. Provide a brief description of the relationships between the five ratings.*\n\nLet's first take a closer look at the data so we know the names of the variables we're interested in.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(Rateprof)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 366\nColumns: 17\n$ gender          <fct> male, male, male, male, male, male, male, male, male, …\n$ numYears        <int> 7, 6, 10, 11, 11, 10, 7, 11, 11, 7, 11, 6, 4, 10, 11, …\n$ numRaters       <int> 11, 11, 43, 24, 19, 15, 17, 16, 12, 18, 11, 33, 23, 34…\n$ numCourses      <int> 5, 5, 2, 5, 7, 9, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 8, 5, 2, 7, …\n$ pepper          <fct> no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes, no, y…\n$ discipline      <fct> Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum, Hum,…\n$ dept            <fct> English, Religious Studies, Art, English, Spanish, Spa…\n$ quality         <dbl> 4.636364, 4.318182, 4.790698, 4.250000, 4.684211, 4.23…\n$ helpfulness     <dbl> 4.636364, 4.545455, 4.720930, 4.458333, 4.684211, 4.26…\n$ clarity         <dbl> 4.636364, 4.090909, 4.860465, 4.041667, 4.684211, 4.20…\n$ easiness        <dbl> 4.818182, 4.363636, 4.604651, 2.791667, 4.473684, 4.53…\n$ raterInterest   <dbl> 3.545455, 4.000000, 3.432432, 3.181818, 4.214286, 3.91…\n$ sdQuality       <dbl> 0.5518564, 0.9020179, 0.4529343, 0.9325048, 0.6500112,…\n$ sdHelpfulness   <dbl> 0.6741999, 0.9341987, 0.6663898, 0.9315329, 0.8200699,…\n$ sdClarity       <dbl> 0.5045250, 0.9438798, 0.4129681, 0.9990938, 0.5823927,…\n$ sdEasiness      <dbl> 0.4045199, 0.5045250, 0.5407021, 0.5882300, 0.6117753,…\n$ sdRaterInterest <dbl> 1.1281521, 1.0744356, 1.2369438, 1.3322506, 0.9749613,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow let's use the `pairs()` function to take a look at how these variables relate to one another.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npairs(Rateprof[, c(\"quality\", \"helpfulness\", \"clarity\", \"easiness\", \"raterInterest\")])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_JustineShakespeare_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt appears as if quality, helpfulness, and clarity all have a strong positive linear relationship with one another.
