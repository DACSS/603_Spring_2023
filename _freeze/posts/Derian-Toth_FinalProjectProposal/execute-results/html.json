While the wage gap has decreased overall since 1980, women still make less than men. In 2022 women made on average, about 82 cents for every dollar men make (Aragao, 2023). This is shown in the line graph blelow In the line graph below (Female Salary Percent of Male Salary).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#wage gap by year\n#Would also like to add a legend and labels to the this graphs\nearnings_female%>%\n  filter(str_detect(group,\"Total, 16 years and older\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = percent)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = percent)) +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary\", \n       x=\"Year\", \n       y=\"Percent of Salary\") +\n  ylim(0,100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/wage gap over time-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Data set\n  \n\nThe data used in this exploration and analysis originated from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau, however the datasets used in this analysis came from a Tidy Tuesday data dive. These data describe different variables about women in the workforce across time. The three data frames are: (1) historical data, providing the percent of earnings women make compared to men, broken down by age group and ranging from 1979 - 2011, (2) Another historical dataset providing the workforce information (percent of women and men working full time and part time), by year, ranging from 1968 - 2016, (3) and lastly, detailed data regarding occupation (including two levels of categorization for the occupation), earnings for those occupations by gender, and percent of earnings women make compared to men, ranging from 2013 - 2016.\n\n\nThe tables below provide the descriptive statistics for the dependent variable, womens' wage percent of male wage. The first table is the dependent variable across occupations and year (from 2013 to 2016). The second table below show the dependent variable for women who are 16 years or older, across many years (1979 - 2011).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Descriptive Statistics for the dependent variable: wage percent of male \nSumWage<-data_frame(jobs_gender$year, jobs_gender$wage_percent_of_male)\n\nSumWage<- SumWage%>%\n  rename('Year'='jobs_gender$year',\n         'wage_percent_of_male' = 'jobs_gender$wage_percent_of_male')\nsumtable(SumWage)  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Summary Statistics</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Variable </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> N </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mean </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Std.

Occupation is categorized into broad and detailed categories, and will be explored by comparing female dominated fields compared to male dominated fields.\n  \nThese factors have been explored in the literature, though the question regarding age (Aragao, 2023; Blau & Kahn, 2016; Kochhar, 2023) has been more thoroughly explored than occupation (Wrohlich 2017). Wrohlick, 2017 found that there is less of a wage gap in the public sector when compared to the private sector. This analysis goes beyond comparing occupation by private versus public and into male dominated versus female dominated, something that has been done considerably less and is an important piece of knowing where to target closing the wage gap. \n\n\n### Hypothesis  \n\nAccording to the research, the wage gap for a woman widens as she gets older (Aragao, 2023; Blau & Kahn, 2016; Kochhar, 2023), and the wage gap is wider for women in the private sector compared to the public sector (Wrohlich 2017). Based on this literature, we hypothesize that younger woman and women working in traditionally female-dominated fields will experience a smaller wage gap than older women and those working in traditionally male-dominated fields.\n\n\n#### Wage Gap by Age\n\nThe graph below shows the average wage gap across age groups. These data show that as women age, the wage gap widens, it takes a particular dip around 35 - 44 years old.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#wage gap by age\nearnings_female %>%\n  group_by(group) %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(group,\"Total, 16 years and older\")) %>%\n  summarize(Mean_Percent_salary = mean(percent))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(group,Mean_Percent_salary)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = group)) +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary\",\n       x=\"Age Group\", \n       y=\"Average Percent of Salary\") +\n  geom_text(aes(y=Mean_Percent_salary, \n                label=sprintf(\"%0.2f\", round(Mean_Percent_salary, digits = 2)))) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/wage gap by age-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne hypothesis for this is that the younger generation is experiencing a more narrow wage gap. And in that case, we would expect to the see wage gap decrease across time.\n\n\nThe graph and table below shows the the wage gap across time using the same data. From these visualizations we can conclude that the wage gap did not decrease, and that as women age, the wage gap widens.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#wage gap by year\nSummaryYear <- jobs_gender %>%\n  group_by(year)%>%\n  drop_na(wage_percent_of_male)%>%\n  summarise(Average_Percent_of_Salary = mean(wage_percent_of_male))\n\nkable(SummaryYear)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> year </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Average_Percent_of_Salary </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2013 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 83.77102 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2014 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 83.70873 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2015 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84.45372 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2016 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84.19526 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njobs_gender %>%\n  group_by(year)%>%\n  drop_na(wage_percent_of_male)%>%\n  summarise(Mean_wage_percent_of_males = mean(wage_percent_of_male))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(fill = year, y = `Mean_wage_percent_of_males`, x=year)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary by Year\",\n       x=\"Year\", \n       y=\"Average Percent of Salary\") +\n  geom_text(aes(y=Mean_wage_percent_of_males, \n                label=sprintf(\"%0.2f\", round(Mean_wage_percent_of_males, digits = 2)))) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/wage by year-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Wage Gap by Occupation   \n\n\nTo investigate wage gap by occuapation, we are comparing male-dominated vs. female dominated occupations.

and our dependent variable of female wage percent of male. This visualization tells us that starting at age 25, womens' percent of mens' earnings already starts to decrease, with a significant drop at age 35. The literature believes this to be true due to women beginning to have children (Aragao, 2023; Kochhar, 2023).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nearnings_female %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(group,

boxplot visualization above. When younger women (age groups 16-19 years old) are compared to women 25 years or older, there is a significant difference in percent of male earnings (p value of 0.0000). That is to say, once a women turns 25, she is already getting paid significantly less than her own gender at ages 16-24. Also shown in these results is  with every age group jump, a woman makes significantly less than the age group before (p value 0.000) until a woman reaches 55 years old. There is not a significant difference between female earnings for women in the 45 - 54 and 55-64 age groups. Then women a woman turns 65+ she begins to make significantly more than the women in age group before her, yet she is still making an average of about 73% of her male peers. \n\n### Relationship Between Occupation and Wage Gap\n  \nThe second independent variable investigated was whether gender domination in an occupation has a relationship to the female percent of male earnings. We hypothesized that the wage gap is bigger in male dominated occupations, therefore the female percent of male earnings would be lower in those occupations. We looked at this in two different ways. \n\nFirst, a new variable was created, *gender_dominatedV*. For occupations with 50.1% or higher of females this variable was coded as \"0\", for occupations made up of 50% or lower of females this variable was coded as \"1\". \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Using minor_category and percent_female variables to create a new variable of \"female dominated\" vs. \"male dominated\"\n\n#gender_dominated<-data_frame(jobs_gender$occupation, jobs_gender$percent_female)\n\n#head(jobs_gender)\n#kable(gender_dominated[order(gender_dominated$`jobs_gender$percent_female`, gender_dominated$`jobs_gender$occupation`, decreasing = TRUE),])\n\n\njobs_gender<-jobs_gender%>%\n  mutate(gender_dominatedV = case_when(percent_female >=50.1 ~ 0,\n                                       percent_female <=50 ~ 1))\n#head(jobs_gender)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the two visualizations below, we can see that there is a negative relationship between male dominated occupations and female percent of male earnings. This means, women make less of a percent of their male colleagues in male dominated fields, than women working in female dominated fields. The second visualization is taking a different perspective, looking at the percent of women in the field, and the percent of male earnings. Here we can see a positive relationship, again communicating that as the amount of women in an occupation increase (in proportion to men), their percent of earnings increases. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = jobs_gender, aes(x = wage_percent_of_male, y = gender_dominatedV)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/relationship between occupation and wage gap-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = jobs_gender, aes(x = wage_percent_of_male, y = percent_female)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/relationship between occupation and wage gap-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo know if this relationship is significant, a regression analysis was run. Missing data were considered in this analysis. Data from the variable *wage_percent_of_male* were coded as NAs if the sample size of an occupation was too low. Therefore, these missing data was found to be \"missing not at random\" and we dropped the missing data in the regression analyses. However is it noted since this could bias the data as it does not include the entire data-set's set of occupations.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(jobs_gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      year       occupation        major_category     minor_category    \n Min.   :2013   Length:2088        Length:2088        Length:2088       \n 1st Qu.:2014   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :2014   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :2014                                                           \n 3rd Qu.:2015                                                           \n Max.   :2016                                                           \n                                                                        \n total_workers      workers_male     workers_female    percent_female  \n Min.   :    658   Min.   :      0   Min.   :      0   Min.   :  0.00  \n 1st Qu.:  18687   1st Qu.:  10765   1st Qu.:   2364   1st Qu.: 10.73  \n Median :  58997   Median :  32302   Median :  15238   Median : 32.40  \n Mean   : 196055   Mean   : 111515   Mean   :  84540   Mean   : 36.00  \n 3rd Qu.: 187415   3rd Qu.: 102644   3rd Qu.:  63326   3rd Qu.: 57.31  \n Max.   :3758629   Max.   :2570385   Max.   :2290818   Max.   :100.00  \n                                                                       \n total_earnings   total_earnings_male total_earnings_female\n Min.   : 17266   Min.   : 12147      Min.   :  7447       \n 1st Qu.: 32410   1st Qu.: 35702      1st Qu.: 28872       \n Median : 44437   Median : 46825      Median : 40191       \n Mean   : 49762   Mean   : 53138      Mean   : 44681       \n 3rd Qu.: 61012   3rd Qu.: 65015      3rd Qu.: 54813       \n Max.   :201542   Max.   :231420      Max.   :166388       \n                  NA's   :4           NA's   :65           \n wage_percent_of_male gender_dominatedV\n Min.   : 50.88       Min.   :0.0000   \n 1st Qu.: 77.56       1st Qu.:0.0000   \n Median : 85.16       Median :1.0000   \n Mean   : 84.03       Mean   :0.6705   \n 3rd Qu.: 90.62       3rd Qu.:1.0000   \n Max.   :117.40       Max.   :1.0000   \n NA's   :846                           \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(earnings_female)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Year         group              percent     \n Min.   :1979   Length:264         Min.   :56.80  \n 1st Qu.:1987   Class :character   1st Qu.:69.40  \n Median :1995   Mode  :character   Median :75.50  \n Mean   :1995                      Mean   :76.88  \n 3rd Qu.:2003                      3rd Qu.:86.90  \n Max.   :2011                      Max.   :95.40  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(employed_gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      year      total_full_time total_part_time full_time_female\n Min.   :1968   Min.   :80.30   Min.   :14.00   Min.   :71.90   \n 1st Qu.:1980   1st Qu.:81.80   1st Qu.:16.80   1st Qu.:73.20   \n Median :1992   Median :82.60   Median :17.40   Median :73.90   \n Mean   :1992   Mean   :82.64   Mean   :17.36   Mean   :73.86   \n 3rd Qu.:2004   3rd Qu.:83.20   3rd Qu.:18.20   3rd Qu.:74.70   \n Max.   :2016   Max.   :86.00   Max.   :19.70   Max.   :75.40   \n part_time_female full_time_male  part_time_male \n Min.   :24.60    Min.   :86.60   Min.   : 7.80  \n 1st Qu.:25.30    1st Qu.:89.00   1st Qu.: 9.60  \n Median :26.10    Median :89.50   Median :10.50  \n Mean   :26.14    Mean   :89.49   Mean   :10.51  \n 3rd Qu.:26.80    3rd Qu.:90.40   3rd Qu.:11.00  \n Max.   :28.10    Max.   :92.20   Max.   :13.40  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(GenDomReg<-lm(wage_percent_of_male ~ gender_dominatedV, data = jobs_gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wage_percent_of_male ~ gender_dominatedV, data = jobs_gender)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-32.390  -6.533   1.030   6.448  34.131 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

That is, the more women in a field, the smaller the wage gap. \n\nIn the first regression, we compared our binary variable to the female percent of male earnings to find a significant, negative relationship. This analysis resulted in a p value of 0.00153 and an adjusted R-squared of 0.00727. From this we can conclude that in male dominated fields, women make less percent of male earnings than in the female dominated fields. \n\nIn the second regression, we compared percent of women in an occupation with female percent of male earnings and found a significant positive relationship. The analysis resulted in a p value of 8.27e-05 and an adjusted R-squared of 0.01163. From this we can gather that as percent of women in an occupation increase, women begin to make more percent of male earnings than women in male dominated fields. \n\nA third regression was then run in order to control for total earnings and total workers (results below). We decided to use the percent of women variable rather than the binary variable because that yeilded a stronger relationship to percent of earnings. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(GenDomReg3<-lm(wage_percent_of_male ~ percent_female + total_earnings + total_workers, data = jobs_gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wage_percent_of_male ~ percent_female + total_earnings + \n    total_workers, data = jobs_gender)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-31.594  -6.323   0.881   6.551  33.669 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

However, the significant level decreases (p value of 0.00129), whereas the adjusted R-squared increases (0.02039). This means that we have a stronger model as a whole, however the relationship between our IV and DV has lost strength. \n\nFrom these regressions we can conclude that the wage gap is statistically significantly greater for women in male-dominated occupations, than it is for women in female-dominated occupations. \n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nFrom this analysis we can conclude that there is a signification relationship between both occupation and wage gap as well as age and wage gap. The results showed that as the percent of women in an occupation increase, the percent of male earnings also increased. This means that women in female-dominated fields experience a small wage gap than those in male-dominated fields. That said, women in female-dominated fields get paid less on average than women in male-dominated fields. \n\nWe can also conclude that as a woman gets older, she gets paid less percent of male earnings. With every age group jump, a woman made a significantly lower percent of male earnings than the prior age group. \n\n## Limitations\n\nThis investigation had hoped to analyze the interaction between the two independent variables (age and occupation), however the occupation data ranged from 2011 to 2013 and the age data ranged from 1979 to 2011. Therefore, we were unable to look at the interaction between age and occupation, which tells us only a portion of the influence of our independent variables on wage gap. \n\n## Bibliography\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#citation(\"readr\")\n#citation(\"ggplot2\")\n#citation(\"tidyverse\")\n#citation(\"stringr\")\n#citation(\"dplyr\")\n#citation(\"vtable\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAragão, C., 2023.
