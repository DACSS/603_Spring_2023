While the wage gap has decreased overall since 1980, women still make less than men. In 2022 women made on average, about 82 cents for every dollar men make (Aragao, 2023). This is shown in the line graph below (Female Salary Percent of Male Salary).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#wage gap by year\n#Would also like to add a legend and labels to the this graphs\nearnings_female%>%\n  filter(str_detect(group,\"Total, 16 years and older\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = percent)) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = percent)) +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary\", \n       x=\"Year\", \n       y=\"Percent of Salary\") +\n  ylim(0,100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/wage gap over time-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The Data set  \nThe data used in this exploration and analysis originated from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau, however the three datasets came from a Tidy Tuesday data dive. These data describe different variables about women in the workforce across time, ages, and occupations. The three datasets are: (1) historical data, providing the percent of earnings women make compared to men, broken down by age group and ranging from 1979 - 2011, (2) Another historical dataset providing the workforce information (percent of women and men working full time and part time), by year, ranging from 1968 - 2016, (3) and lastly, detailed data regarding occupation (including two levels of categorization for the occupation), earnings for those occupations by gender, and percent of earnings women make compared to men, ranging from 2013 - 2016.\n  \nThe tables below provide the descriptive statistics for the dependent variable, female wage percent of male earnings. The first table is the dependent variable across occupations and year (from 2013 to 2016). The second table shows the dependent variable for women who are 16 years or older from 1979 to 2011.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Descriptive Statistics for the dependent variable: wage percent of male \nSumWage<-data_frame(jobs_gender$year, jobs_gender$wage_percent_of_male)\n\nSumWage<- SumWage%>%\n  rename('Year'='jobs_gender$year',\n         'wage_percent_of_male' = 'jobs_gender$wage_percent_of_male')\nsumtable(SumWage)  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>Summary Statistics</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Variable </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> N </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Mean </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Std.

Occupation is categorized into broad and detailed categories, and will be explored by comparing female dominated and male dominated occupations.\n  \nThese factors have been explored in the literature. Many have found that the wage gap is smaller for younger women than older (Aragao, 2023; Blau & Kahn, 2016; Kochhar, 2023). And Wrohlick, 2017 found that there is less of a wage gap in the public sector when compared to the private sector. This analysis goes beyond comparing occupation by private versus public and into male dominated versus female dominated. This is something that has been done considerably less and is an important piece of knowing where to target closing the wage gap. \n  \n### Hypotheses  \nAccording to the research, the wage gap for a woman widens as she gets older (Aragao, 2023; Blau & Kahn, 2016; Kochhar, 2023), and the wage gap is wider for women in the private sector compared to the public sector (Wrohlich 2017). Based on this literature, we hypothesize that younger woman and women working in traditionally female-dominated fields will experience a smaller wage gap than older women and those working in traditionally male-dominated fields.\n\n\n#### Wage Gap by Age  \nThe graph below shows the average wage gap across age groups. These data show that as women age, the wage gap widens, and takes a particular dip around 35 - 44 years old.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#wage gap by age\nearnings_female %>%\n  group_by(group) %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(group,\"Total, 16 years and older\")) %>%\n  summarize(Mean_Percent_salary = mean(percent))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(group,Mean_Percent_salary)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = group)) +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary by Age Group\",\n       x=\"Age Group\", \n       y=\"Average Percent of Salary\") +\n  geom_text(aes(y=Mean_Percent_salary, \n                label=sprintf(\"%0.2f\", round(Mean_Percent_salary, digits = 2)))) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/wage gap by age-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne hypothesis for this is that the younger generation is experiencing a more narrow wage gap. And in that case, we would expect to the see wage gap decrease across time.\n  \nThe graph and table below shows the the wage gap across time using the same data. From these visualizations we can conclude that the wage gap did not decrease, and that as women age, the wage gap widens.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#wage gap by year\nSummaryYear <- jobs_gender %>%\n  group_by(year)%>%\n  drop_na(wage_percent_of_male)%>%\n  summarise(Average_Percent_of_Salary = mean(wage_percent_of_male))\n\nkable(SummaryYear)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> year </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Average_Percent_of_Salary </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2013 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 83.77102 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2014 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 83.70873 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2015 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84.45372 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2016 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 84.19526 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njobs_gender %>%\n  group_by(year)%>%\n  drop_na(wage_percent_of_male)%>%\n  summarise(Mean_wage_percent_of_males = mean(wage_percent_of_male))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(fill = year, y = `Mean_wage_percent_of_males`, x=year)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary by Year\",\n       x=\"Year\", \n       y=\"Average Percent of Salary\") +\n  geom_text(aes(y=Mean_wage_percent_of_males, \n                label=sprintf(\"%0.2f\", round(Mean_wage_percent_of_males, digits = 2)))) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/wage by year-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Wage Gap by Occupation    \nTo investigate wage gap by occupation, we are comparing male-dominated vs. female dominated occupations.

relationship between our first independent variable of age group and our dependent variable of female wage percent of male. This visualization tells us that starting at age 25, womens' percent of mens' earnings already starts to decrease, with a significant drop at age 35. The literature believes this to be true due to women beginning to have children (Aragao, 2023; Kochhar, 2023).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nearnings_female %>%\n  filter(!str_detect(group, \"Total, 16 years and older\"))%>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = percent)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F) +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary by Age\", \n       x=\"Age Group\", \n       y=\"Percent of Salary\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/relationship between age and wage gap-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Analysis of Relationship Between Age and Wage Gap  \nAn Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run to investigate the relationship between age group and female earnings percent of male, controlling for year. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(AgeANOVA<-aov(percent~group + Year, data = earnings_female))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    \ngroup         7  21094    3013   308.2 <2e-16 ***\nYear          1   4819    4819   492.9 <2e-16 ***\nResiduals   255   2493      10                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe results of the ANOVA show a significant relationship between the age groups with a p value of <2e-16.

When younger women (age groups 16-19 years old) are compared to all age groups 25 years or older, there is a significant difference in percent of male earnings (p value of 0.0000). That is to say, once a women turns 25, she is already getting paid significantly less than her own gender at ages 16-24. Also shown in these results is  with every age group jump, a woman makes significantly less than the age group before (p value 0.000) until a woman reaches 55 years old. There is not a significant difference between female earnings for women in the 45 - 54 and 55-64 age groups. Then women a woman turns 65+ she begins to make significantly more than the women in age group before her, yet she is still making an average of about 73% of her male peers. \n\n### Relationship Between Occupation and Wage Gap  \nThe second independent variable investigated was whether gender dominated in an occupation has a relationship to the female percent of male earnings. We hypothesized that the wage gap is bigger in male dominated occupations, therefore the female percent of male earnings would be lower in those occupations. We looked at this in two different ways. \n\nFirst, a new variable was created, *gender_dominatedV*. For occupations with 50.1% or higher of females this variable was coded as \"0\", for occupations made up of 50% or lower of females this variable was coded as \"1\". In other words, \"Male-domindated\" is coded as \"1\" and \"Female-Dominated\" is coded as \"0\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Using minor_category and percent_female variables to create a new variable of \"female dominated\" vs. \"male dominated\"\n\n#gender_dominated<-data_frame(jobs_gender$occupation, jobs_gender$percent_female)\n\n#head(jobs_gender)\n#kable(gender_dominated[order(gender_dominated$`jobs_gender$percent_female`, gender_dominated$`jobs_gender$occupation`, decreasing = TRUE),])\n\n\njobs_gender<-jobs_gender%>%\n  mutate(gender_dominatedV = case_when(percent_female >=50.1 ~ 0,\n                                       percent_female <=50 ~ 1))\n#head(jobs_gender)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the two visualizations below, we can see that there is a negative relationship between male dominated occupations and female percent of male earnings. This means, women make less of a percent of their male colleagues' earnings in male dominated fields, than do women working in female dominated fields. The second visualization is taking a different perspective. Using a different version of the same variable, we compared percent of women in the occupation with the percent of male earnings. Here we can see a positive relationship, communicating that as the amount of women in an occupation increase (in proportion to men), their percent of earnings increases. Both visualizations show that women in male-dominated fields make less of a percent of their male peers than women working in female-dominated fields. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = jobs_gender, aes(x = gender_dominatedV, y = wage_percent_of_male)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F) +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary by Gender Dominated Occuption\", \n       x=\"Gender Dominated\", \n       y=\"Percent of Salary\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/relationship between occupation and wage gap-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = jobs_gender, aes(x = percent_female, y = wage_percent_of_male)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=F) +\n  labs(title = \"Female Salary Percent of Male Salary by Percent of Women in Occupations\", \n       x=\"Percent of Women\", \n       y=\"Percent of Salary\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Derian-Toth_FinalProjectProposal_files/figure-html/relationship between occupation and wage gap-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Analysis of Relationship Between Occupation and Wage Gap  \nTo know if this relationship is statistically significant, two regression analyses were run. Missing data were considered in this analysis. Data from the variable *wage_percent_of_male* were coded as NAs if the sample size of an occupation was too low (with a count of 846 NAs). Therefore, these missing data were found to be \"missing not at random\". These data were dropped when running the regressions. However is it noted since this could bias the data as it does not include the entire data-set's set of occupations.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(jobs_gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      year       occupation        major_category     minor_category    \n Min.   :2013   Length:2088        Length:2088        Length:2088       \n 1st Qu.:2014   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Median :2014   Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n Mean   :2014                                                           \n 3rd Qu.:2015                                                           \n Max.   :2016                                                           \n                                                                        \n total_workers      workers_male     workers_female    percent_female  \n Min.   :    658   Min.   :      0   Min.   :      0   Min.   :  0.00  \n 1st Qu.:  18687   1st Qu.:  10765   1st Qu.:   2364   1st Qu.: 10.73  \n Median :  58997   Median :  32302   Median :  15238   Median : 32.40  \n Mean   : 196055   Mean   : 111515   Mean   :  84540   Mean   : 36.00  \n 3rd Qu.: 187415   3rd Qu.: 102644   3rd Qu.:  63326   3rd Qu.: 57.31  \n Max.   :3758629   Max.   :2570385   Max.   :2290818   Max.   :100.00  \n                                                                       \n total_earnings   total_earnings_male total_earnings_female\n Min.   : 17266   Min.   : 12147      Min.   :  7447       \n 1st Qu.: 32410   1st Qu.: 35702      1st Qu.: 28872       \n Median : 44437   Median : 46825      Median : 40191       \n Mean   : 49762   Mean   : 53138      Mean   : 44681       \n 3rd Qu.: 61012   3rd Qu.: 65015      3rd Qu.: 54813       \n Max.   :201542   Max.   :231420      Max.   :166388       \n                  NA's   :4           NA's   :65           \n wage_percent_of_male gender_dominatedV\n Min.   : 50.88       Min.   :0.0000   \n 1st Qu.: 77.56       1st Qu.:0.0000   \n Median : 85.16       Median :1.0000   \n Mean   : 84.03       Mean   :0.6705   \n 3rd Qu.: 90.62       3rd Qu.:1.0000   \n Max.   :117.40       Max.   :1.0000   \n NA's   :846                           \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(earnings_female)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Year         group              percent     \n Min.   :1979   Length:264         Min.   :56.80  \n 1st Qu.:1987   Class :character   1st Qu.:69.40  \n Median :1995   Mode  :character   Median :75.50  \n Mean   :1995                      Mean   :76.88  \n 3rd Qu.:2003                      3rd Qu.:86.90  \n Max.   :2011                      Max.   :95.40  \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(employed_gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      year      total_full_time total_part_time full_time_female\n Min.   :1968   Min.   :80.30   Min.   :14.00   Min.   :71.90   \n 1st Qu.:1980   1st Qu.:81.80   1st Qu.:16.80   1st Qu.:73.20   \n Median :1992   Median :82.60   Median :17.40   Median :73.90   \n Mean   :1992   Mean   :82.64   Mean   :17.36   Mean   :73.86   \n 3rd Qu.:2004   3rd Qu.:83.20   3rd Qu.:18.20   3rd Qu.:74.70   \n Max.   :2016   Max.   :86.00   Max.   :19.70   Max.   :75.40   \n part_time_female full_time_male  part_time_male \n Min.   :24.60    Min.   :86.60   Min.   : 7.80  \n 1st Qu.:25.30    1st Qu.:89.00   1st Qu.: 9.60  \n Median :26.10    Median :89.50   Median :10.50  \n Mean   :26.14    Mean   :89.49   Mean   :10.51  \n 3rd Qu.:26.80    3rd Qu.:90.40   3rd Qu.:11.00  \n Max.   :28.10    Max.   :92.20   Max.   :13.40  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(GenDomReg<-lm(wage_percent_of_male ~ gender_dominatedV, data = jobs_gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wage_percent_of_male ~ gender_dominatedV, data = jobs_gender)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-32.390  -6.533   1.030   6.448  34.131 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

That is, the more women in a field, the smaller the wage gap. \n  \nIn the first regression (*GenDomReg*), we compared our binary variable (*gender_dominatedV*) to the female percent of male earnings (*wage_percent_of_male*) to find a significant, negative relationship. This analysis resulted in a p value of 0.00153 and a coefficient of -1.6920 (adjusted R-squared of 0.00727). This means the relationship between male dominated occupations and female percent of male earnings is negative. That is, female percent of male earnings decreases by 1.6% for women in male-dominated occupations. From this we can conclude that women working in male dominated occupations make significantly less of what men make, compared to the women working in female dominated occupations. \n  \nIn the second regression (*GenDomReg2*), we compared percent of women in an occupation with female percent of male earnings and found a significant positive relationship. The analysis resulted in a p value of 8.27e-05 and a coefficient of 0.04258 (adjusted R-squared of 0.01163). These results reflect a positive relationship between percent of women in the occupation and wage percent of male. This means, that as the percent of women in the occupation increases, the percent of earnings increases by .04%. From this analysis we can gather that as percent of women in an occupation increase, women make significantly more percent of male earnings than women in male dominated occupations. \n  \nA third regression was then run in order to control for total earnings and total workers (results below). We decided to use the percent of women variable rather than the binary variable because that yeilded a stronger relationship to percent of earnings. \n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(GenDomReg3<-lm(wage_percent_of_male ~ percent_female + total_earnings + total_workers, data = jobs_gender))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wage_percent_of_male ~ percent_female + total_earnings + \n    total_workers, data = jobs_gender)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-31.594  -6.323   0.881   6.551  33.669 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

However, the significant level decreases (p value of 0.00129), whereas the adjusted R-squared increases (0.02039). This means that we have a stronger model as a whole, however the relationship between our IV and DV has lost strength. The coefficients of the predictor variable is 3.561e-02. This indicates a positive relationship between percent female and female percent of male earnings. This means, as the percent of women in an occupation increases by 1%, the female percent of male earnings increases by 3.561e-02% (0.03561 or about 0.04%). These results indicate that as the proportion of women in an occuption increases, the women in that occupation are paid more relative to their male peers when compared to women working in an occupation with a lower proportion of females. \n  \nFrom these regressions we can conclude that the wage gap is statistically significantly greater for women in male-dominated occupations, than it is for women in female-dominated occupations. \n  \n#### Model Comparison and Diagnosis.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn<-1646\n\n#GenDomReg\nRSS1<-deviance(GenDomReg)\nGenDomRegAIC<-n*log(RSS1/n) + 2*1\n#print(GenDomRegAIC)\n#6893.216\nGenDomRegBIC<-n*log(RSS1/n) + log(n)*1\n#print(GenDomRegBIC)\n#6898.623\n\n#GenDomReg2\nRSS2<-deviance(GenDomReg2)\nGenDomReg2AIC<-n*log(RSS2/n) + 2*1\n#print(GenDomReg2AIC)\n#6885.975\nGenDomReg2BIC<-n*log(RSS2/n) + log(n)*1\n#print(GenDomReg2BIC)\n#6891.381\n\n#GenDomReg3\nRSS3<-deviance(GenDomReg3)\nGenDomReg3AIC<-n*log(RSS3/n) + 2*3\n#print(GenDomReg3AIC)\n#6872.658\nGenDomReg3BIC<-n*log(RSS3/n) + log(n)*3\n#print(GenDomReg3BIC)\n#6888.876\n\n#Creating a dataframe of my model comparison indicators\nModel<- c('GenDomReg', 'GenDomReg2', 'GenDomReg3')\nAIC<-c(6893.22, 6885.98, 6872.66)\nBIC<-c(6898.62, 6891.38, 6888.88)\np_value<-c('0.00153**', '8.27e-05***', '0.00129**')\nAdjusted_R_Squared<-c(0.00727, 0.01163, 0.02039)\nCoefficient<-c(-1.692, 0.04258, 3.56E-02)\nModel_Comparison<-data.frame(Model, AIC, BIC, p_value, Adjusted_R_Squared, Coefficient)\n\n#Putting the model comparison indicators in a table\nkable(Model_Comparison)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Model </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> AIC </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> BIC </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> p_value </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Adjusted_R_Squared </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Coefficient </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> GenDomReg </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6893.22 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6898.62 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0.00153** </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.00727 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -1.69200 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> GenDomReg2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6885.98 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6891.38 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 8.27e-05*** </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.01163 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.04258 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> GenDomReg3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6872.66 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6888.88 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 0.00129** </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.02039 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.03560 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo compare the thre models we consider the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), p value, and adjusted R-squared.

That is, there is a significant relationship between both independent variables (*age group* and *gender_dominatedV*) and the dependent variable (*wage_percent_of_male*). The results showed that as a woman gets older, she gets paid less percent of male earnings. With every age group jump, a woman made a significantly lower percent of male earnings than the prior age group. \n  \nWe can also conclude that as the percent of women in an occupation increase, the percent of male earnings also increased. This means that women in female-dominated fields experience a smaller wage gap than those in male-dominated fields. That said, women in female-dominated fields get paid less on average than women in male-dominated fields. \n  \n## Limitations  \nThis investigation had hoped to analyze the interaction between the two independent variables (age and occupation), however the occupation data ranged from 2011 to 2013 and the age data ranged from 1979 to 2011. Therefore, we were unable to look at the interaction between age and occupation, which tells us only a portion of the influence of our independent variables on wage gap. \n\n## References  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#citation(\"readr\")\n#citation(\"ggplot2\")\n#citation(\"tidyverse\")\n#citation(\"stringr\")\n#citation(\"dplyr\")\n#citation(\"vtable\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAragão, C., 2023.
