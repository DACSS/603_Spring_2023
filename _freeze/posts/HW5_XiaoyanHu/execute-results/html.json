They will be consistent with what you see on the tables.\nHint 2: The p-value of a variable in a simple linear regression is the same p-value one would get from a Pearson’s correlation (cor.test). The p-value is a function of the magnitude of the correlation coefficient (the higher the coefficient, the lower the p-value) and of sample size (larger samples lead to smaller p-values). For the correlations shown in the tables, they are between variables of the same length.)\nWith these four predictors,\n\nA. For backward elimination, which variable would be deleted first? Why?\n\nBackward elmination asks to delete the largest p-value which is beds vs house and all other p-values are inside significant level\n\n\nB. For forward selection, which variable would be added first? Why?\n\nSize would be added first because size has smallest significant value\n\nC. Why do you think that BEDS has such a large P-value in the multiple regression model, even though it has a substantial correlation with PRICE?\nthe varible beds is not precisely describe the room number. It may also be described as study, lounge and so on. therefore, it has large p value. \n\nD. Using software with these four predictors,find the model that would beselectedusing each criterion:\n1.

Note that the diameter (in inches) is erroneously labeled Girth in the data. It is measured at 4 ft 6 in above the ground.”\nTree volume estimation is a big deal, especially in the lumber industry.

In Palm Beach County in south Florida, for example, voters used a so-called butterfly ballot. Some believe that the layout of the ballot caused some voters to cast votes for Buchanan when their intended choice was Gore.\nThe data has variables for the number of votes for each candidate—Gore, Bush, and Buchanan.\nA. Run a simple linear regression model where the Buchanan vote is the outcome and the Bush vote is the explanatory variable. Produce the regression diagnostic plots.
