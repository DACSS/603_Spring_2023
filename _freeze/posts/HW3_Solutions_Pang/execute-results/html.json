We can imagine a negative-sloped straight line going through those points.\n\n## Question 2\n\n### (a)\n\nThe conversion from USD to British pound will mean the numerical value of the response will be divided by 1.33. To offset that, the slope will also become divided by 1.33.\n\n### (b)\n\nCorrelation will not change because it is a standardized measure that is not influenced by the unit of measurement.\n\nBoth outcomes can easily be shown via simulation.\n\n\n## Question 3\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(water)\npairs(water)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_solutions_Pang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n1. `Year` appears to be largely unrelated to each of the other variables\n2. The three variables starting with “O” seem to be correlated with each other, meaning that all the plot including two of these variables exhibit a dependence between the variables that is stronger than the dependence between the “O” variables and other variables. The three variables starting with “A” also seem to be another correlated group\n3. `BSAAM` is more closely related to the “O” variables than the “A” variables\n\n\n## Question 4\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(Rateprof)\npairs(Rateprof[,c('quality', 'clarity', 'helpfulness',\n                  'easiness', 'raterInterest')])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_solutions_Pang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe very strong pair-wise correlation among quality, clarity, and helpfulness is very striking.\neasiness is also correlated fairly highly with the other three.\nraterInterest is also moderately correlated, but raters almost always say they are at least moderately interested in the subject.\nOverall, the results might show that people don't necessarily distinguish all these dimensions very well in their minds---or that professors that do one in one dimension tend to do well on the others too.\n\n\n## Question 5\n\n### (a)\n\nOne way of visually representing the relationship between religiosity and political ideology is as follows (and there are other ways). As we go towards bars to the right (more religiousity), we see lighter colors pop up (more conservatism)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(student.survey)\nggplot(data = student.survey, aes(x = re, fill = pi)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_solutions_Pang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe relationship between high school GPA and hours of watching TV can be shown with a good old scatter plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = student.survey, aes(x = tv, y = hi)) +\n  geom_point() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](HW3_solutions_Pang_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### (b)\n\nDealing with ordinal variables in linear regression is a difficult problem.\nWe'll just go ahead and assume that we can just convert them to numeric and use them.\nThis would be done for political ideology and religiosity.\nHigh school GPA and hours of TV are already continuous.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- lm(as.numeric(pi) ~ as.numeric(re), \n         data = student.survey)\nm2 <- lm(hi ~ tv, data = student.survey)\nstargazer(m1, m2, type = 'text', \n          dep.var.labels = c('Pol.
