A positive relationship would indicate that higher ratings in one variable tend to be associated with higher ratings in the other variable.\nHelpfulness vs. Clarity: Examine the relationship between the helpfulness and clarity ratings. If there is a positive relationship, it suggests that instructors who are rated as more helpful also tend to be rated as more clear in their teaching.\nEasiness vs. Other Ratings: Consider the relationship between the easiness rating and the other ratings. A positive relationship would indicate that courses perceived as easier tend to receive higher ratings in terms of quality, helpfulness, clarity, and rater interest.\nRaterInterest vs. Other Ratings: Look for any relationships between the raterInterest rating and the other ratings. A positive relationship would indicate that instructors who teach subjects that students are more interested in tend to receive higher ratings in terms of quality, helpfulness, clarity, and easiness.\n\n5(a):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(student.survey)\nggplot(data = student.survey , aes(x=re, y=pi)) + geom_point() +\n  labs(title=\"Religion and Political Ideology\",\n        x =\"Frequency attending religious services\", y = \"Political ideology\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework3_sai_pothula_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = student.survey, aes(x=tv, y=hi)) + geom_point() +\n  labs(title=\"Scatter Plot Hours watching TV and High School GPA\",\n        x =\"Average hours watching TV\", y = \"High School GPA\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework3_sai_pothula_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n5(b):\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel1 <- lm(as.numeric(pi) ~ as.numeric(re), data = student.survey)\nsummary(model1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = as.numeric(pi) ~ as.numeric(re), data = student.survey)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.81243 -0.87160  0.09882  1.12840  3.09882 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.

For every additional hour of TV watched per week, the GPA score is expected to decrease by approximately 3 points. However, the relationship is weak or low, and eliminating outliers may not significantly change the results. Furthermore, the low R-squared value indicates that TV hours explain only a small portion of the GPA score.\n\n",
