According to Maslach and Leiter (2016), burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. It is prevalent in a variety of fields, including healthcare (West et al., 2016), among other professions. Burnout can have serious consequences, including decreased job satisfaction, increased absenteeism, and turnover (West et al., 2016).\n\nThere is a growing body of research exploring the causes and consequences of burnout, as well as potential solutions. Some scholars have identified factors such as job demands, lack of control, and social support as contributing to burnout (Bakker & Demerouti, 2017).\n\nMalesic (2022) emphasizes on working conditions as key factor in burnout in organizations. In particular when the employer doesn't reward enough, or unfairness is a common practice, or there is a lack of community among coworkers, then the ability and willingness to keep doing the job disintegrate.\n\nLee & Eissenstat (2017), for instance, affirm that psychological job demands and work-to-family conflict, as well as control over working hours/schedule, decision-making authority, and role clarity, have significant effects on burnout.\n\n\n\n### Research Question.\n\nThis research paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of **how the type of business and seniority level explain the level of burnout.**\n\n\n### Hypotheses.\n\nIn this research we expect that:\n\nH1.  Working in Services (vs product type of business) predicts a significantly higher burnout rate, especially in Female workers.\n\nH2.  Fewer years of experience (lower seniority) is significantly related to a higher burnout rate.\n\nH3.  The numbers of work hours allocated affect the burnout rate significantly in employees working from home setup (vs on site).\n\n### Data analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Loading packages\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(data.table))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(psych))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(scales))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(lattice))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(formattable))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(kableExtra))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))\n\n# Reading the data.\n\nburn <- read.csv(\"_data/burnout.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset was obtained from:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blurredmachine/are-your-employees-burning-out\n\nLet's see the strucutre of the dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Structure\nstr(burn)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n'data.frame':\t22750 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ Employee.ID         : chr  \"fffe32003000360033003200\" \"fffe3700360033003500\" \"fffe31003300320037003900\" \"fffe32003400380032003900\" ...\n $ Date.of.Joining     : chr  \"2008-09-30\" \"2008-11-30\" \"2008-03-10\" \"2008-11-03\" ...\n $ Gender              : chr  \"Female\" \"Male\" \"Female\" \"Male\" ...\n $ Company.Type        : chr  \"Service\" \"Service\" \"Product\" \"Service\" ...\n $ WFH.Setup.Available : chr  \"No\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\" \"Yes\" ...\n $ Designation         : num  2 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 3 3 ...\n $ Resource.Allocation : num  3 2 NA 1 7 4 6 4 6 6 ...\n $ Mental.Fatigue.Score: num  3.8 5 5.8 2.6 6.9 3.6 7.9 4.4 NA NA ...\n $ Burn.Rate           : num  0.16 0.36 0.49 0.2 0.52 0.29 0.62 0.33 0.56 0.67 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset contain 9 variables and 22750 observations.\n\nFour of the variables are categorical and five are numeric (including one as date).\n\nAccording to the source of the data, here is an definition of each variable:\n\nEmployee ID: The unique ID allocated for each employee.\n\nDate of Joining: The date-time when the employee has joined the organization.\n\nGender: The gender of the employee\n\nCompany Type: The type of company where the employee is working\n\nWFH Setup Available: Is the work from home facility available for the employee\n\nDesignation: The designation (designations refer to the expertise and qualifications a person must complete certain jobs) of the employee of work in the organization.

R2 for model 1 is 0.9205 and for model 2 (with quadratic fatigue) is 0.9235\n2. AIC, BIC and PRESS are very close among the two models\n3. and, that in the model 2 any slightly violations of assumptions founded in model 1.\n\nWe can say that both models works very well to explain burnout rate. But I feel more comfortable with Model 2 where the Mental Fatigue has a quadratic transformation as the R2 is higher for this model.\n\n\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThere is a positive relationship between burnout and designation level.\n\nThis means that Alternative Hypothesis 2 can’t be accepted as it states a negative relationship between those two variables.\n\nOn the other hand, Alternative Hypothesis 1 stated that being in Services and being female is related to a higher burnout rate, and the results indicate that the type of business is not relevant to predict burnout, and being female is neither associated with higher burnout.\n\nHowever, gender explains in part the burnout. In particular, being female is associated with a lower burnout rate compared to male employees.\n\nLastly, concerning Alternative Hypothesis 3, the number of hours allocated is positively related to burnout; in particular, working on-site is associated with more working hours for males and females compared to employees working from home. However, within the group of employees working on-site, males seem to have significantly more hours allocated than females.\n\nUltimately, the number of working hours and mental fatigue are the most relevant variables to explain burnout. Gender and WFH setup seems relevant regarding how the hours are allocated. Being male working on site absorbs more work hours, therefore more burnout.\n\n\n\n\n### **References**:\n\nBakker, A.
