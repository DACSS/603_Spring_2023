The COVID-19 pandemic heightened the mental health challenges of health care workers around the world (Teisman et al., 2021). Numerous studies show that health care workers are prone to compassion fatigue due to working long hours in stressful work environments with continuous exposure to trauma (Jennings, 2009; Rodriguez & Carlotta, 2017; Peters, 2018; Yayha et al., 2021; Carrard et al., 2022; Shin et al., 2022).\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) found that 30% of surveyed medical students and residents met the criteria for depression and 10% reported having suicidal thoughts (Pasturel, 2020). Previous studies conducted on samples of health care workers in Switzerland, Iraq, and South Korea examined the impact of gender on burnout, finding that female medical students had higher rates of empathy and burnout than male coworkers (Carrard et al., 2022; Yahya et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2022). A 2009 multi-site study of medical students in the U.S. found statistically significant differences in depression by gender but not by ethnicity (Goebert et al., 2009). In contrast, the same study found statistically significant differences in suicidal ideation by ethnicity, but not by gender, with Black students reporting the highest rates of suicidal ideation & Caucasian students reporting the lowest rates of suicidal ideation (Goebert et al., 2009).\n\n*Research Question: Why are some medical students more likely to experience burnout than others?*\n\n## Hypothesis Testing\n\nI want to explore further how ethnic identity might serve as a protective or risk factor for the burnout of medical students, specifically for international medical students. A 2022 study of medical school students in Croatia found that international medical students experience higher rates of burnout mediated by social and familial loneliness (Gradiski et al., 2022). For my final project I will test whether or not a student's first language being a national language of Switzerland -- where the sample was taken -- impacts their burnout. The commonly spoken national languages of Switzerland are French, German, and Italian (Kużelewska, 2016).\n\n*Hypothesis: Medical students whose native language is a national language of the country where they are studying will experience lower rates of burnout than medical students with other native languages.*\n\nThe reasoning behind my hypothesis is if a medical student's native language is one of the national language of Switzerland, they will have benefit from potential protective factors of social, cultural, and familial connections. In contrast, I expect medical students whose native language is not German, French, or Italian to be at higher risk for burnout mediated through increased stress from coping with different culture, language, and physical separation from their family.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\nThe data set I will be analyzing contains demographic information on 886 medical students in Switzerland. Students answered demographic information about their age, gender, their year in school and well as the results of self-reported empathy, depression, anxiety, and burnout. The data set was downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/medical-student-mental-health?select=Codebook+Carrard+et+al.+2022+MedTeach.csv but originally sourced for a 2022 publication in the Medical Teacher Journe by Carrard et al.\n\nImportant variables I want to explore in my data set as potential risk and protective factors:\n\n-   Native Language\n-   Age\n-   Gender\n-   Having a romantic partner\n-   Seeing a psychotherapist\n-   Hours worked\n-   Jefferson Scale Empathy (JSPE) total empathy score\n-   Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE) Cognitive empathy score\n-   Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy QCAE Affective empathy score\n-   Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) total score\n-   State & Trait Anxiety (STAI) score\n-   Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Emotional Exhaustion\n-   Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Cynicism\n-   Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Academic Efficacy\n\nEach of the various empathy, mental health, and burnout scales are scored differently, so care needs to be taken in interpreting these findings.For example, a higher score on the emotional exhaustion and cynicism scales of the MBI indicate higher burn out, while a higher score on the MBI personal achievement indicates lower levels of burnout (Maslach et al., 1996).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

The sample is also mostly female (68%), with less than 1% identifying as non-binary. Over half (56%) of the medical students reported having partners, but only about a third of medical students had a paid job (34.9%). The most common (45%) report from medical students was that they were satisfied with their health and less than one quarter (22.5%) of medical student reported seeing a therapist in the last 12 months.\n\nFinally, I created a several box plots comparing the empathy, mental health, and burnout scores of medical students whose native language is a national language of Switzerland vs. students whose native language is not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Empathy Score\n\nggplot(data = FinalRecoded, aes(x= NatLang, y = jspe, fill = NatLang)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot - JSPE measure of Empathy\", x = \"Native Language Spoken\", y = \"JSPE\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](EmmaNarkewicz_FinalProject_CheckIn1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the box plot of JSPE scores, native speakers of national languages have slightly higher median empathy than non-native students, though they are very close and there appear to be several low outliers for native speakers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Depression Score\nggplot(data = FinalRecoded, aes(x= NatLang, y = cesd, fill = NatLang)) + geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot - cesd measure of Depression\", x = \"Native Language Spoken\", y = \"cesd\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](EmmaNarkewicz_FinalProject_CheckIn1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNon-native national language speakers have a higher median on CESD than native national language speakers, suggesting higher depression.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Anxiety Score\nggplot(data = FinalRecoded, aes(x= NatLang, y = stai_t, fill = NatLang)) + geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot - stai_t measure of Anxiety\", x = \"Native Language Spoken\", y = \"stai_t\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](EmmaNarkewicz_FinalProject_CheckIn1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNon-native national languages speakers also seem to score higher for anxiety as measured by the stai_t.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Emotional Exhaustion Burnout Score\nggplot(data = FinalRecoded, aes(x= NatLang, y = mbi_ex, fill = NatLang)) + geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot - mbi_ex Emotional Burnout\", x = \"Native Language Spoken\", y = \"mbi_ex\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](EmmaNarkewicz_FinalProject_CheckIn1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNative language speaking and non-native language speaking medical students seemed to have nearly identical median scores for Emotional Exhaustion (mbi_ex).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Cynicism Score\nggplot(data = FinalRecoded, aes(x= NatLang, y = mbi_cy, fill = NatLang)) + geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot - mbi_cy Cynicism Burnout\", x = \"Native Language Spoken\", y = \"mbi_cy\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](EmmaNarkewicz_FinalProject_CheckIn1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNon-native speaking medical students appeared to score slightly higher on average than non-native speaking medical students on Cynicism as measured by the mbi-cy, with a higher median score.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Academic Efficacy Score\nggplot(data = FinalRecoded, aes(x= NatLang, y = mbi_ea, fill = NatLang)) + geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot - mbi-ea Academic Efficacy Burnout\", x = \"Native Language Spoken\", y = \"mbi_ea\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](EmmaNarkewicz_FinalProject_CheckIn1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLastly, Native language speaking and non-native language speaking medical students seemed to have nearly identical median scores for Personal Achievement burnout (mbi_ea).\n\nI look forward to analyzing the data set and testing my hypothesis in the coming weeks, as well as getting feedback on this proposal.\n\n## Works Cited\n\nCarrard, V., Bourquin, C., Berney, S, Schlegel, K., Gaume, J., Bart, P-A., Preisig M., Mast, M.
