The sample mean and sample\nstandard deviation for wait times (in days) of patients for two cardiac\nprocedures are given in the accompanying table. Assume that the sample\nis representative of the Ontario population.\n\n| Surgical Procedure | Sample Size | Mean Wait Time | Standard Deviation |\n|--------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| Bypass             | 539         | 19             | 10                 |\n| Angiography        | 847         | 18             | 9                  |\n\nConstruct the 90% confidence interval to estimate the actual mean wait\ntime for each of the two procedures. Is the confidence interval narrower\nfor angiography or bypass surgery?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# setting seed for reproducible results\nset.seed(0)\n\n# 90% confidence interval for bypass\nbypass_ci <- t.test(x=c(rnorm(539, mean=19, sd=10)), conf.level=0.90)$conf.int\n\n# 90% confidence interval for bypass\nangiography_ci <- t.test(x=c(rnorm(847, mean=18, sd=9)), conf.level=0.90)$conf.int\n\n# print results\ncat(\"Bypass 90% confidence interval:\", bypass_ci, \"\\n\"\n    , \"Angiography 90% confidence interval:\", angiography_ci, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nBypass 90% confidence interval: 18.32586 19.74194 \n Angiography 90% confidence interval: 17.09532 18.10881 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see from the results, bypass' 90% confidence interval is\n18.6-20.1, while angiography's is 17.5-18.5. Therefore, angiography's\nconfidence interval is narrower.\n\n# Question 2\n\nA survey of 1031 adult Americans was carried out by the National Center\nfor Public Policy. Assume that the sample is representative of adult\nAmericans. Among those surveyed, 567 believed that college education is\nessential for success. Find the point estimate, p, of the proportion of\nall adult Americans who believe that a college education is essential\nfor success. Construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for p.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# setting seedd for reproducible results\nset.seed(0)\n\n# point estimate\npoint_estimate <- 567/1031\n\n# 95% confidence interval\nproportion_test <- prop.test(567, 1031, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int\n\n# print results\ncat(\"Point estimate:\", point_estimate, \"\\n\"\n    , \"95% confidence interval:\", proportion_test, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPoint estimate: 0.5499515 \n 95% confidence interval: 0.5189682 0.580558 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results indicate that we are 95% confident that the true proportion\nof all adult Americans who believe that college education is essential\nfor success lies between .52-.58. In other words, we can say with 95%\ncertainty that 52%-58% of adult Americans believe that college is\nessential for success.\n\n# Question 3\n\nSuppose that the financial aid office of UMass Amherst seeks to estimate\nthe mean cost of textbooks per semester for students. The estimate will\nbe useful if it is within \\$5 of the true population mean (i.e. they\nwant the confidence interval to have a length of \\$10 or less). The\nfinancial aid office is pretty sure that the amount spent on books\nvaries widely, with most values between \\$30 and \\$200. They think that\nthe population standard deviation is about a quarter of this range (in\nother words, you can assume they know the population standard\ndeviation). Assuming the significance level to be 5%, what should be the\nsize of the sample?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# margin of error formula\n## ME = z * (sigma / sqrt(n))\n### solving for n\n#### n = (z * sigma/ME)^2\n##### replacing values\n###### z = significance level 5% = critical z value for 95% conf int = 1.96\n###### sigma = 1/4 of range of textbook costs = (200-30)/4 = 42.5\n###### ME = estimate within 5 of the true population mean = 5\n\n# calculate result\nn <- round((1.96*42.5/5)^2)\n\n# print result\ncat(\"Ideal sample size:\", n, \"\\n\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nIdeal sample size: 278 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing the margin of error formula for confidence intervals and solving\nfor n (sample size), we see that the ideal sample size (rounded to the\nnearest integer) is 278.\n\n# Question 4\n\nAccording to a union agreement, the mean income for all senior-level\nworkers in a large service company equals \\$500 per week. A\nrepresentative of a women's group decides to analyze whether the mean\nincome μ for female employees matches this norm. For a random sample of\nnine female employees, ȳ = \\$410 and s = 90.\n\nA.  Test whether the mean income of female employees differs from \\$500\n    per week. Include assumptions, hypotheses, test statistic, and\n    P-value. Interpret the result.\n\n    1.  Assumptions:\n\n        a.  The data is normally distributed.\n\n        b.  The sample is a simple random sample.\n\n        c.  The standard deviation of the population is unknown.\n\n    2.  Hypotheses:\n\n        a.  H0: μ = 500\n\n        b.  H1: Ha: μ ≠ 500\n\n    3.  Test statistic:\n\n        a.  t = (ȳ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n)) = (410 - 500) / (90 / sqrt(9)) =\n            -3\n\n    4.  P-value:\n\n        a.  The P-value is 0.01707168, which is less than the level of\n            significance of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null\n            hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to\n            suggest that the mean income of female employees differs\n            from \\$500 per week.\n\nB.  Report the P-value for Ha: μ \\< 500. Interpret.\n\n    1.  The P-value is 0.008535841, which is less than the level of\n        significance of 0.05. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis\n        and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that\n        the mean income of female employees is less than \\$500 per week.\n\nC.  Report and interpret the P-value for Ha: μ \\> 500.\n\n    1.  The P-value is 0.9914642, which is more than the level of\n        significance of 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null\n        hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to\n        suggest that the mean income of female employees is greater than\n        \\$500 per week.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# A.3.a.

Jones gets ȳ = 519.5, with se = 10.0.\nSmith gets ȳ = 519.7, with se = 10.0.\n\nA.  Show that t = 1.95 and P-value = 0.051 for Jones. Show that t = 1.97\n    and P-value = 0.049 for Smith.\n\n    1.  Jones:\n\n        a.  t = (ȳ - μ) / se = (519.5 - 500) / 10 = 19.5 / 10 = 1.95\n\n        b.  P-value = round(2 \\* pt(q=1.95, df=999,\n            lower.tail=FALSE), 3) = 0.051\n\n    2.  Smith:\n\n        a.  t = (ȳ - μ) / se = (519.7 - 500) / 10 = 19.7 / 10 = 1.97\n\n        b.  P-value = round(2 \\* pt(q=1.97, df=999,\n            lower.tail=FALSE), 3) = 0.049\n\nB.  Using α = 0.05, for each study indicate whether the result is\n    \"statistically significant.\"\n\n    1.  Since Jones' P-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the\n        null hypothesis, indicating that his results are not\n        statistically significant. In contrast, Smith's P-value is less\n        than 0.05, therefore we reject the null hypothesis and find his\n        results statistically significant.\n\nC.  Using this example, explain the misleading aspects of reporting the\n    result of a test as \"P ≤ 0.05\" versus \"P \\> 0.05,\" or as \"reject H0\"\n    versus \"Do not reject H0,\" without reporting the actual P-value.\n\n    1.   \"P ≤ 0.05\" or \"reject H0\" without reporting the actual P-value\n        can be misleading because it doesn't provide information on how\n        strong the evidence is against the null hypothesis. For example,\n        both Jones and Smith barely pass the 0.05 threshold, having\n        0.049 and 0.051, respectively. Reporting this would help readers\n        and analysts to take the strength of the evidence in\n        consideration (in this case, \"rejecting H0\" or \"failing to\n        reject H0\" should be taken with a grain of salt).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# A.1.b.
