Not only that, but it has been praised for having some of the happiest workers[^1] [^2].\n\n[^1]: Fox, M. (2016, November 11). *Why Are Tech Workers So Satisfied With Their Jobs?* Retrieved March 17, 2023, from https://www.forbes.com/sites/meimeifox/2016/11/11/why-are-tech-workers-so-satisfied-with-their-jobs/?sh=4eac1918a059\n\n[^2]: Wronski, L., & Cohen, J.

Retrieved March 17, 2023, from https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/this-is-the-industry-that-has-some-of-the-happiness-workers-in-america.html\n\nBut, what has made this industry so appealing? A case study on Google published in the International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility in 2017[^3] points to several elements that make high-tech unique, such as having a distinct culture proposition, aligning individual behaviors to company-wide goals, having managers be coaches rather than bosses, and being able to interact with people from other cultures.\n\n[^3]: Kim, K. T. (2017). GOOGLE: A reflection of culture, leader, and management. *International Journal of Corporate Social Responsibility*, *2*(10). https://doi.org/10.1186/s40991-017-0021-0\n\nEvidently, Google is one-in-a-million high-tech company, but there are certainly commonalities shared with smaller new tech (startup) companies. Culture Amp, a company focused on surveying employees in startups, elaborated an analysis based on their results from 2015-2020 surveys[^4] and mention that elements such as an open and honest two-way communication, workplace flexibility, and fair division of workload, are what make new tech companies valued.\n\n[^4]: McPherson, J. (n.d.). *Tech company cultures are not all the same*. Culture Amp. Retrieved March 17, 2023, from https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/tech-company-culture\n\nHowever, the previous data omits the downsides of such cultures. Besides the multiple blog posts and news articles one can find talking about burnout[^5], the darker side of tech also includes (but is not limited to) ageism[^6], gender inequality[^7] [^8], and even migration issues[^9] [^10].\n\n[^5]: Goncharov, A.

An industry that once employed over 5 million people in the US alone[^11] and had nearly 700 billion dollars in funding worldwide[^12] has now laid off over 300 thousand people[^13] and nearly halved in funding.\n\n[^11]: The United States Bureau of Labor and Statistics via CompTIA (2023, March 3). *Cyberstates 2021: The Definitive Guide to the Tech Industry and Workforce*.

Specifically, the proposed research question is:\n\n-   **What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of workers in the technology industry as measured by pre- and post-pandemic surveys, and what are the factors associated with any observed changes?**\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Hypothesis\n\nA survey lead by Blind in 2021[^14] found that, out of 2400 workers in tech, 64% said their mental health is worse after the pandemic. However, this is an after-the-fact study (i.e., it does not have a baseline to compare with), therefore the present analysis aims to further expand on this idea and use an evidence-based approach to determine whether there is a significant change or not.\n\n[^14]: Blind (2021, January 29). *Deteriorating Mental Health In The Workplace*. Retrieved March 17, 2023, from https://www.teamblind.com/blog/index.php/2021/01/29/deteriorating-mental-health-in-the-workplace/\n\nBased on the present research question and on previous studies, these are the hypotheses that come to mind:\n\n-   H1: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of workers in the technology industry, as measured by pre- and post-pandemic surveys.\n\n-   H2: The magnitude of this impact will by moderated by demographic factors such as age, gender, as well as past experiences with mental illness such as family history and previous treatments. These will act as gatekeepers for this impact.\n\n-   H3: Company information such as number of employees and policies with regards to mental health care will act as mediators. These will buffer or amplify the effects of the pandemic and layoffs on mental health.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Descriptive Statistics\n\nTo prove whether the COVID pandemic has significantly impacted the mental health of workers in tech, I will rely on data provided by the Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMH), specifically using their Mental Health in Tech Survey.\n\nOSMH[^15] is a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. It began operations in 2013 and since 2014 it has conducted and published an annual or bi-annual survey analyzing several mental health indicators.\n\n[^15]: Open Sourcing Mental Health (n.d.). *About OSMH*. Retrieved March 18, 2023, from https://osmhhelp.org/about/about-osmi.html\n\nAs of March 20, 2023, the 2022 survey has not yet been published. Therefore, this analysis compares the 2019 Mental Health in Tech Survey against the 2021 edition. Both are publicly available on Kaggle under a Creative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International license:\n\n-   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmihelp/osmi-mental-health-in-tech-survey-2019>\n\n-   <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmihelp/osmh-2021-mental-health-in-tech-survey-results>\n\nGiven the size of the data, both files were appended using Microsoft Excel and were then exported to a CSV file. Also, there was not a 100% match between columns in both files, and some re-coding had to be implemented before importing into R. The steps taken to consolidate both files offline are noted in the section below.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n-   A \"year\" column was added to differentiate between both files.\n\n-   Data pertaining to insurance information (e.g., \"Does you company provide a mental health insurance plan?\") was removed because in the 2019 it was optional and was, therefore, almost entirely blank.\n\n-   Both files contained columns pertaining to the mental disorder each respondent may or may not have. However, these columns were inconsistent and could not be interpreted without making assumptions which may lead to an incorrect interpretation of the data. For that reason, these columns were removed.\n\n-   The raw data files followed a title case naming convention (e.g., \"Does your employer provide mental health resources?\"). All column names were changed to a snake_case format (e.g., \"employer_provides_mental_health_resources\").\n\n-   The rest of the columns and data therein contained is left as is.\n:::\n\n\n:::
