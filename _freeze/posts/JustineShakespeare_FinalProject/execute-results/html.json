According to the World Health Organization, approximately 287,000 women died from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth in 2020.[^1] Recently it was reported that global declines in maternal mortality have stalled,[^2] even increased in the United States,[^3] and data from 2020 has shown the pandemic brought a sharp uptick in maternal deaths.[^4] The World Health Organization has stated that the majority of maternal deaths are preventable.[^5]\n\n[^1]: Maternal mortality, World Health Organization (2023) https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality\n\n[^2]: Global Declines in Maternal Mortality Have Stalled, New York Times (2023) https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/22/health/pregnancy-complications-death-who.html\n\n[^3]: Singh GK.

Many studies have found that factors associated with maternal healthcare, such as the presence of a skilled attendant at birth and antenatal visits, are strongly associated with maternal mortality.[^6] [^7] Other studies considering social determinants of health have found that factors such as adult literacy, education, income levels, and access to water and sanitation are all associated with maternal mortality.[^8] [^9] The majority of maternal deaths occur in low-income countries.[^10]\n\n[^6]: Betrán, A.P., Wojdyla, D., Posner, S.F. et al.

In addition, this research will examine the mechanism through which women's political inclusion might impact maternal mortality by considering the percentage of skilled attendants at birth as a mediator variable.\n\nPast research has found a link between higher levels of gender equality and women's political inclusion and reduced maternal mortality, although analysis has primarily focused on individual countries or a subset of countries (typically lower-income).[^11] [^12] This research will investigate whether these trends hold true when looking at over 150 countries from all levels of economic development.\n\n[^11]: Chirowa F, Atwood S, Van der Putten M.

NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, (June 2022) https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30103/w30103.pdf\n\nIn short, this analysis seeks to answer the question: Does women's political inclusion and empowerment have an effect on maternal mortality?\n\n## Hypotheses\n\n**Hypothesis 1:** Where gender exclusion is low and political inclusion of women is high, health outcomes are better and maternal mortality is low. This will hold true even when controlling for variables which are known to have an effect on both women's political inclusion and maternal mortality.\n\n**Hypothesis 2:** The political inclusion and empowerment of women has a positive effect on the presence of skilled attendants at birth, which in turn has the effect of reducing maternal mortality. In other words, the relationship between gender exclusion and maternal mortality is mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth.\n\nIn investigating these two hypotheses, this analysis will explore the link between the political inclusion of women and reduced maternal mortality and try to provide insight into the mechanism through which this occurs.\n\n## Introduction to the Data\n\nThis research will utilize several datasets in order to capture all of the relevant variables.\n\nThe dependent variable, **Maternal Mortality Ratio**, is drawn from the *Maternal and newborn health* table from *UNICEF*. This data is from 2017.[^13]\n\n[^13]: The State of the World's Children 2021: Statistical tables, UNICEF (2021) https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/the-state-of-the-worlds-children-2021-statistical-tables/\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Definitions\n\nAccording to the **World Health Organization**, the **maternal mortality ratio (MMR)** is defined as: \"the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period.\"\n\n**Maternal deaths** are defined as: \"deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy...\"[^14]\n:::\n\n[^14]: Indicator Metadata Registry List, https://www.who.int/data/gho/indicator-metadata-registry/imr-details/26\n\nThe **explanatory variable** featured in this analysis will be drawn from the *Varieties of Democracy V-Dem* dataset.[^15] From there, the following variable will be used:\n\n[^15]: Coppedge, Michael, John Gerring, Carl Henrik Knutsen, Staffan I. Lindberg, Jan Teorell, David Altman, Michael Bernhard, Agnes Cornell, M.

(2023, V-Dem Working Paper Series 2023:21); V-Dem Codebook (see suggested citation at the top of this document).\n\n[^17]: Coppedge, Michael, John Gerring, Carl Henrik Knutsen, Staffan I. Lindberg, Jan Teorell, David Altman, Michael Bernhard, Agnes Cornell, M. Steven Fish, Lisa Gastaldi, Haakon Gjerløw, Adam Glynn, Sandra Grahn, Allen Hicken, Katrin Kinzelbach, Kyle L.

The codebook notes that the point estimates are reversed here, so unlike most of the variables from V-Dem, for this variable the \"lower scores indicate a normatively better situation...and higher scores a normatively worse situation\".[^18] So higher values of this variable indicate more gender exclusion and less political inclusion of women. In order to match the timeframe of the dependent variable, the 2017 values have been used for this analysis.\n\n[^18]: Coppedge, Michael, John Gerring, Carl Henrik Knutsen, Staffan I.

As noted above, research has shown that the presence of skilled attendants at birth has a negative effect on maternal mortality.[^19] The second hypothesis of this research is that more political inclusion of women will have the effect of increasing the percentage of births with a skilled attendant, which will in turn reduce maternal mortality. This research will include a variable from the same *Maternal and newborn health* table from *UNICEF* that the maternal mortality data was drawn from.[^20] This mediator variable is the percentage of births that occur with a skilled attendant in each country.\n\n[^19]: MATERNAL MORTALITY AND WOMEN'S POLITICAL POWER, Sonia R.

This variable is drawn from the *International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s* data.[^21] GDP per capita from 2017 will be used in order to be consistent with the rest of the data.\n\n[^21]: https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPDPC\\@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD\n\nIn addition to GDP, this analysis will also include a confounding variable on the **government expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP**. This will be drawn from the *Economic Indicators* table from *UNICEF*. This data is from 2017*.*[^22]\n\n[^22]: The State of the World's Children 2021: Statistical tables, UNICEF (2021) https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/the-state-of-the-worlds-children-2021-statistical-tables/\n\nFinally, a variable capturing the level of **democracy** in a country will be used as a confounding variable in this analysis. This variable was drawn from the V-Dems data.[^23] According to the codebook, this variable was \"computed by subtracting the autocracy score from the democracy score. The resulting unified POLITY scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic).\"[^24] This variable will see to control for social and political elements that may effect both gender exclusion and maternal mortality.\n\n[^23]: Coppedge, Michael, John Gerring, Carl Henrik Knutsen, Staffan I.

First, data from the Maternal and Newborn Health table from UNICEF for the explanatory variable and the confounding variable on skilled birth attendants will be loaded and cleaned. A second dataset from UNICEF will be loaded and joined with this one because it includes a world regions variable that will allow us to group and visualize the data.

The interaction term was also not significant, indicating that we do not need to keep it. Interestingly, the model without the interaction term or the `Expend_Health_pct_GDP` variable was the weakest of the three, with the lowest R\\^2 value. This indicates that while the `Expend_Health_pct_GDP` variable is not significant, its presence improves the model. Since the first two models have such similar R\\^2 values, we can review the AIC and BIC values to compare these models.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbroom::glance(MMR_1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squa…¹ sigma stati…²  p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC devia…³\n      <dbl>        <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>\n1     0.770        0.762 0.836    99.7 9.63e-46     5  -189.  392.  413.    104.\n# … with 2 more variables: df.residual <int>, nobs <int>, and abbreviated\n#   variable names ¹​adj.r.squared, ²​statistic, ³​deviance\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbroom::glance(MMR_2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squa…¹ sigma stati…²  p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC devia…³\n      <dbl>        <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>\n1     0.770        0.761 0.838    82.8 8.74e-45     6  -189.  394.  418.    104.\n# … with 2 more variables: df.residual <int>, nobs <int>, and abbreviated\n#   variable names ¹​adj.r.squared, ²​statistic, ³​deviance\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe model without the interaction term is slightly stronger as the AIC and BIC are slightly smaller. The model without the interaction term has an AIC of 392.101 and a BIC of 413.405 The model with the interaction term has an AIC of 393.7846 and a BIC of 418.132.\n\nThe strongest model that will be used in diagnostics will be MMR_1, the model without the interaction term. This model supports the hypothesis that women's political inclusion has an effect on maternal mortality. While the `logGenderExclusion` variable was found to have a more significant effect on `logMMR2017` without any confounders, once control variables were introduced the model became stronger and a better fit and the effect of `logGenderExclusion` remained statistically significant.\n\nThe final model can be written:\n\n**logMMR2017 = 12.28 + 0.2799logGenderExclusion + 0.0126Democracy - 0.0236SkilledBirthAttendant - 0.6601logGDP2017 - 0.0679Expend_Health_Pct_GDP**\n\nWhich indicates that, controlling for democracy, the percentage of births with skilled attendants, GDP, and the percentage of GDP spent on health, a one unit increase in logGenderExclusion increases logMMR2017 by 0.28. A 1% increase in `GenderExclusion` leads to a 0.2785% increase in `Maternal_Mortality_2017`.\n\n*Formula:* 1% increase in x multiplies y by exp(0.2799\\*log(1.01)), and increases y by 0.2799\\*log(1.01) = 0.2785\n\n### Hypothesis #2\n\n*A note about the mediation analysis: I tried this analysis with the logged version of the GenderExclusion variable and with the regular version and they had different results. Both had significant results, but in different ways. I don't understand mediation analysis well enough to know which we should go with. Woul dbe great to chat mor about this in depth. For now I am including both models in this writeup.*\n\nHypothesis #2 posits that the relationship between gender exclusion and maternal mortality is mediated by the presence of skilled attendants at birth. This hypothesis proposes that the empowerment and inclusion of women in a country has a positive effect on the presence of skilled attendants at birth, which in turn has the effect of reducing maternal mortality. As discussed in the introduction, previous research has identified the presence of a skilled attendant at birth as a factor that reduces the incidence of maternal mortality.[^25] [^26] This research question seeks to determine whether the presence of a skilled birth attendant acts as a mediator between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable in this analysis.\n\n[^25]: Betrán, A.P., Wojdyla, D., Posner, S.F. et al.

PMID: 29142757; PMCID: PMC5674830. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5674830/>\n\nThe process of mediation analysis involves identifying a model that shows the *total effect* (the effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable without the presence of the mediator variable), and two models that show *indirect effect* (the effect between the explanatory variable and the mediator, and the mediator and the dependent variable while controlling for the explanatory variable). Following that, these models are processed through the `mediate()` function, which estimates the mediation relationship.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Total effect model (effect of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable without the presence of the mediator variable).
