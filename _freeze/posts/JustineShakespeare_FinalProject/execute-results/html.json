According to the World Health Organization, approximately 287,000 women died from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth in 2020.[^1] Recently it was reported that global declines in maternal mortality have stalled,[^2] even increased in the United States,[^3] and data from 2020 has shown the pandemic brought a sharp uptick in maternal deaths.[^4] The World Health Organization has stated that the majority of maternal deaths are preventable.[^5]\n\n[^1]: Maternal mortality, World Health Organization (2023) https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality\n\n[^2]: Global Declines in Maternal Mortality Have Stalled, New York Times (2023) https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/22/health/pregnancy-complications-death-who.html\n\n[^3]: Singh GK.

Many studies have found, unsurprisingly, that medical and health-related factors are strongly associated with maternal mortality.[^7] [^8] In developing countries in particular, where the majority of maternal deaths are taking place,[^9] factors related to development, including income levels, adult literacy, access to water and sanitation, as well as health-related factors were also found to be associated with maternal mortality.[^10]\n\n[^7]: Diana S, Wahyuni CU, Prasetyo B.

In particular, variables related to women's political and legal rights and economic empowerment will be explored, as well as those related to family development and early childhood support. In short, this analysis seeks to answer the question: How do factors related to women's empowerment and family development impact maternal mortality?\n\nThis research will utilize several datasets made available by UNICEF as part of the *\"The State of the World's Children 2021\"* set of statistical tables.[^11] Specifically, I will create a new dataset by pulling variables from the following tables:\n\n[^11]: The State of the World's Children 2021: Statistical tables, UNICEF (2021) https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/the-state-of-the-worlds-children-2021-statistical-tables/\n\n-   Table 1 - Demographics\n\n-   Table 2 - Child mortality\n\n-   Table 3 - Maternal and newborn health\n\n-   Table 16 - Economic indicators\n\n-   Table 17 - Women's economic empowerment\n\nThe dependent variable for this research will be the **Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)** from the *Maternal and newborn health* table. The independent variables that will be explored are:\n\n1.  Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI)\n\n2.  Legal frameworks on gender equality in employment\n\n3.  Women's educational attainment\n\n4.  Women's labour force participation rate\n\n5.  Women's financial inclusion\n\n6.  Maternity leave benefits\n\n7.  Paternity leave benefits\n\nAlso under consideration are a few additional variables related to family development and early childhood support such as whether or not the country has ratified ILO convention 156 on workers with family responsibilities.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\n**Hypothesis 1:** Indicators of women's economic and political empowerment, including the SIGI, legal frameworks on gender equality in employment, financial inclusion of women, women's educational attainment and labor force participation rate correlate with a lower maternal mortality rate.\n\n**Hypothesis 2:** Indicators that relate to family development and support, including maternity leave and paternity leave correlate with lower rates of maternal mortality.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\nI spent quite a bit of time loading, cleaning, and joining the original tables from UNICEF, and I have already isolated the variables of interest for this research. I saved this revised dataframe as a csv file that we can load now to take a look at the data we'll be using.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nUNICEF_MMR <- read_csv(\"/Users/justineshakespeare/603-Spring-2023/posts/UNICEF_MMR.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 184 Columns: 29\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (4): Countries_and_areas, SIGI_2019, Maternity_Leave, Paternity_Leave\ndbl (25): Gov_Expend_percent_TOTAL, Gov_Expend_percent_HEALTH, Gov_Expend_pe...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(UNICEF_MMR)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 184\nColumns: 29\n$ Countries_and_areas                    <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Albania\", \"Alge…\n$ Gov_Expend_percent_TOTAL               <dbl> NA, 11.523943, 16.946099, 10.32…\n$ Gov_Expend_percent_HEALTH              <dbl> 0.4859748, 2.8415394, 4.0938535…\n$ Gov_Expend_percent_EDUCATION           <dbl> 4.05887, 3.61172, NA, NA, NA, 5…\n$ Gov_Expend_percent_SOC_Protection      <dbl> 1.844514, 9.471104, NA, NA, NA,…\n$ SIGI_2019                              <chr> \"Very high\", \"Low\", NA, NA, NA,…\n$ LegalFramework_gender_equal_employment <dbl> NA, 80, NA, NA, NA, 60, 80, 100…\n$ Maternity_Leave                        <chr> \"No\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"No\",…\n$ Paternity_Leave                        <chr> \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"Yes\", \"No…\n$ Edu_Attain_Up_Secondary_Male           <dbl> NA, NA, NA, 19.85885, NA, 54.82…\n$ Edu_Attain_Up_Secondary_Female         <dbl> NA, NA, NA, 12.29260, NA, 59.16…\n$ LF_partic_rate_Male_Rural              <dbl> 75.3, 64.4, 74.1, 86.5, NA, 68.…\n$ LF_partic_rate_Male_Urban              <dbl> 72.4, 70.1, 64.5, 72.9, NA, 75.…\n$ LF_partic_rate_Male_Total              <dbl> 74.5, 68.0, 67.8, 78.8, NA, 72.…\n$ LF_partic_rate_Female_Rural            <dbl> 23.6, 49.6, 13.2, 89.5, NA, 48.…\n$ LF_partic_rate_Female_Urban            <dbl> 16.9, 54.1, 18.8, 65.9, NA, 52.…\n$ LF_partic_rate_Female_Total            <dbl> 21.8, 52.5, 17.0, 76.1, NA, 51.…\n$ Mobile_phone_ownership_MALE            <dbl> NA, NA, 92.62, NA, NA, NA, 75.9…\n$ Mobile_phone_ownership_FEMALE          <dbl> NA, NA, 83.07, NA, NA, NA, 76.8…\n$ Financial_Inclusion_Male               <dbl> 22.54, 42.04, 56.25, 36.13, NA,…\n$ Financial_Inclusion_Female             <dbl> 7.16, 38.10, 29.27, 22.33, NA, …\n$ Life_Expectancy_female_2020            <dbl> 66.7, 80.3, 78.3, 64.4, 78.2, 8…\n$ Adolescent_birth_rate_2015to2020       <dbl> 62.0, 14.2, 12.0, 163.0, 27.7, …\n$ Antenatal_care_at_least_ONE_VISIT      <dbl> 65.2, 88.4, 95.3, 81.6, 100.0, …\n$ Antenatal_care_at_least_FOUR_VISITS    <dbl> 20.9, 77.8, 69.8, 61.4, 100.0, …\n$ Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017          <dbl> 638, 15, 112, 241, 42, 39, 26, …\n$ SIGI_num                               <dbl> 5, 2, NA, NA, NA, NA, 2, 1, 1, …\n$ Mat_Leave                              <dbl> 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0…\n$ Pat_Leave                              <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis dataset has 184 observations and 29 variables. Each observation represents a country. The majority of variables are numeric, those that are not were transformed into numeric variables (see the last three variables: SIGI_num, Mat_Leave, Pat_Leave).\n\nNote that right now I have included a larger set of variables that I'd like to explore at this point in the project timeline. For the final project I will likely present a truncated list of just the variables that will be featured in the analysis.\n\nLet's take a closer look at our response variable, the Maternal Mortality Ratio. We can check out the mean, standard deviation, the full range (the lowest and highest values), values in the 25th, and 75th quantiles, as well as the median. This will give us a sense of the full spread of this variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMMR_spread <- UNICEF_MMR %>% \n  summarize(\"Mean\" = mean(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, na.rm = TRUE),\n            \"Standard_Deviation\" = sd(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, na.rm = TRUE),\n            \"Lowest\" = min(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, na.rm = TRUE), \n            \"25th quantile\" = quantile(x = Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, probs = .25),\n            \"Median\" = median(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, na.rm = TRUE),\n            \"75th quantile\" = quantile(x = Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, probs = .75),\n            \"Highest\" = max(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017, na.rm = TRUE))\nMMR_spread\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n   Mean Standard_Deviation Lowest `25th quantile` Median `75th quantile` Highest\n  <dbl>              <dbl>  <dbl>           <dbl>  <dbl>           <dbl>   <dbl>\n1  160.               233.      2            12.8     53            188.    1150\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that there is quite a range, from 2 to 1,150. The relatively large standard deviation indicates there is a fair amount of variability as well. We can see from the median and 75th quantile numbers that most of the countries in this data have MMRs lower than about 190. But the highest value here shows us that some countries have an MMR over 5 times that amount. \n\nLet's take a look at which countries have the highest MMRs (the most deaths per 100,000 live births).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMMR_high <- UNICEF_MMR %>% \n  select(\"Countries_and_areas\", \"Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017\") %>% \n  arrange(desc(as.numeric(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017)))\n\nprint(MMR_high, limit = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 184 × 2\n   Countries_and_areas      Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017\n   <chr>                                            <dbl>\n 1 South Sudan                                       1150\n 2 Chad                                              1140\n 3 Sierra Leone                                      1120\n 4 Nigeria                                            917\n 5 Central African Republic                           829\n 6 Somalia                                            829\n 7 Mauritania                                         766\n 8 Guinea-Bissau                                      667\n 9 Liberia                                            661\n10 Afghanistan                                        638\n# … with 174 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's see which countries have the lowest MMRs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMMR_low <- UNICEF_MMR %>% \n  select(\"Countries_and_areas\", \"Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017\") %>% \n  arrange(as.numeric(Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017))\n\nprint(MMR_low, limit = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 184 × 2\n   Countries_and_areas  Maternal_Mortality_Ratio_2017\n   <chr>                                        <dbl>\n 1 Belarus                                          2\n 2 Italy                                            2\n 3 Norway                                           2\n 4 Poland                                           2\n 5 Czechia                                          3\n 6 Finland                                          3\n 7 Greece                                           3\n 8 Israel                                           3\n 9 United Arab Emirates                             3\n10 Denmark                                          4\n# … with 174 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we'll take a look at some of the explanatory variables we're interested in exploring.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(UNICEF_MMR[, c(\"SIGI_num\", \"LegalFramework_gender_equal_employment\", \n                       \"Edu_Attain_Up_Secondary_Female\", \"LF_partic_rate_Female_Total\", \n                       \"Financial_Inclusion_Female\", \"Mat_Leave\", \"Pat_Leave\")])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    SIGI_num     LegalFramework_gender_equal_employment\n Min.   :1.000   Min.   : 20.0                         \n 1st Qu.:1.000   1st Qu.: 60.0                         \n Median :2.000   Median : 80.0                         \n Mean   :2.458   Mean   : 76.6                         \n 3rd Qu.:3.000   3rd Qu.: 97.5                         \n Max.   :5.000   Max.   :100.0                         \n NA's   :66      NA's   :90                            \n Edu_Attain_Up_Secondary_Female LF_partic_rate_Female_Total\n Min.   : 1.572                 Min.   : 6.00              \n 1st Qu.:35.857                 1st Qu.:44.75              \n Median :59.633                 Median :54.30              \n Mean   :54.149                 Mean   :52.06              \n 3rd Qu.:75.668                 3rd Qu.:61.05              \n Max.   :96.898                 Max.   :83.90              \n NA's   :90                     NA's   :5                  \n Financial_Inclusion_Female   Mat_Leave        Pat_Leave     \n Min.   :  1.67             Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000  \n 1st Qu.: 29.85             1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000  \n Median : 52.28             Median :1.0000   Median :1.0000  \n Mean   : 54.60             Mean   :0.6298   Mean   :0.5967  \n 3rd Qu.: 79.78             3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:1.0000  \n Max.   :100.00             Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.0000  \n NA's   :31                 NA's   :3        NA's   :3       \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is a fair amount of variability between the ranges for each of these variables - some are a binary (such as maternity or paternity leave), with values of either 0 or 1 and nothing in between.
