#Research Question: Can we predict Supreme Court decisison on a certain area of law at a higher percentage than the overall rate?

#Predicting Supreme Court decisions has been a growing area of interest among public law scholars and computer scientietists. Katz, Bommarito II, and Blackman(2018) have set the standard with predictiong more than 28,000 case outcomes at a 70.2% accuracy rate utilizing a time-evolving random forest classifer.

#The question is important because Supreme Court decisions can add or strip away the rights of citizens and having a better understanding of what features are the best predictors of the decisons will allow researchers to better understand judicial decisionmaking.

#Hypothesis: Certain areas of law are more salient and thus will be decided closer to the ideology of the Justices. This means that predicting cases based on certain areas of law should perform better than preidcting all cases.
