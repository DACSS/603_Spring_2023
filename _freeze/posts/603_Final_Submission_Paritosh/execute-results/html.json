victims are found which is in tune with most of the research papers. Secondly as the age grows around 17 to 18 students learn do differentiate with right and wrong victim starts acknowledging it and also a bully starts to realize a behavior which is might hinder their growth in society. Thirdly our data is female focused and is most likely female to female bully this form of bullying involves isolating, threatening, passing false information which could occur at any age.\n\nParents_understand_problems :- Parents understanding problems is a variable statistically significant but logically must not be applicable much likely due to reasons.\n\nFirstly, Parents understanding problems even they did or did not it would not protect them from getting bullied as the act is carried out by a third party in absence of parents.\n\nSecondly, if the students complain and parents act on it by raising an issue with the concerned authorities irrespective of the action taken by authorities on the bully our dataset focuses on whether the victim experienced it in recent times or 12 months ago without taking note of frequency while parents not understanding the problem of bullying or some other problems faced by child is not clearly defined in the dataset.\n\nThirdly. Suppose the parents understand the problem of their kids getting bullied and raises a complaint with the teacher but the teacher fails to solve the problem of it their is not many option apart from changing class or school.\n\nFourthly there is not much clarity on what type of problems of the kid the parent did not understand and also evn if they acknowledge the problem of bullying or did not they cannot do much about it.

plots for cyber bullying provide the same information which the previous 2 variables provided thus not plotting it. Plots have also helped us to individual effects of levels or frequency adverbs such as (1-\\> Never, 2-\\> Barely, 3-\\> Sometimes, 4-\\> Most of the time for the variables \"Felt_lonely\" and \"Other_students_kind_and_helpful\". Hence, its not required to convert these two variable to a factor and create a model and summary gain to learn about effects of individual levels.\n",
