However, it could be that people with better lung capacity are better at smoking and therefore do it more, or the inclusion of children, who are less likely to smoke and also have smaller lung capacities.\n\n### d) Examine the relationship between Smoking and Lung Capacity within age groups: \"Less than or equal to 13\", \"14 to 15\", \"16 to 17\", and \"greater than or equal to 18\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsmoke_df = df%>%\n  mutate(\n   AgeRange = case_when(\n    Age < 14 ~ \"13 and Under\",\n    Age == 14 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n    Age == 15 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n    Age == 16 ~ \"16 to 17\",\n    Age == 17 ~ \"16 to 17\",\n    Age > 17 ~ \"18 and Over\"\n  )) %>%\n  filter(Smoke == \"yes\")%>%\n  group_by(AgeRange)%>%\n    summarize(mean(LungCap, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nnosmoke_df  = df%>%\n  mutate(\n   AgeRange = case_when(\n    Age < 14 ~ \"13 and Under\",\n    Age == 14 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n    Age == 15 ~ \"14 to 15\",\n    Age == 16 ~ \"16 to 17\",\n    Age == 17 ~ \"16 to 17\",\n    Age > 17 ~ \"18 and Over\"\n  )) %>%\n  filter(Smoke == \"no\")%>%\n  group_by(AgeRange)%>%\n    summarize(mean(LungCap, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nsmokeByAge = left_join(smoke_df, nosmoke_df, by = (\"AgeRange\"))\nnames(smokeByAge) = c(\"AgeRange\", \"Smoker\", \"NonSmoker\")\n\nsmokeByAge\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 4 x 3\n  AgeRange     Smoker NonSmoker\n  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 13 and Under   7.20      6.36\n2 14 to 15       8.39      9.14\n3 16 to 17       9.38     10.5 \n4 18 and Over   10.5      11.1 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### e) Compare the lung capacities for smokers and non-smokers within each age group. Is your answer different from the one in part c? What could possibly be going on here?\n\nWhile the youngest age group follows the same trend observed in part c (smokers with higher lung capacity than non-smokers), the inverse is true for all older groups. I suspect that, as I mentioned above, the data is skewed by virture of the fact that older groups are more likely to smoke as well as have a larger lung capacity. When compared within their age range (therefore at similar states of development), the results reflect that smoking likely diminishes lung capacity.\n\n# Question 2: Let X = number of prior convictions for prisoners at a state prison at which there are 810 prisoners\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nconvictionsfreq = data.frame(convictions = c(0,1,2,3,4), frequency = c(128,434,160,64,24))\nconvictionsfreq\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  convictions frequency\n1           0       128\n2           1       434\n3           2       160\n4           3        64\n5           4        24\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### a) What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has exactly 2 prior convictions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n160/(128+434+160+64+24)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.1975309\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### b) What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has fewer than 2 prior convictions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(128+434)/(128+434+160+64+24)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.6938272\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### c) What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has 2 or fewer prior convictions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(128+434+160)/(128+434+160+64+24)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.891358\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### d) What is the probability that a randomly selected inmate has more than 2 prior convictions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(64+24)/(128+434+160+64+24)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.108642\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### e) What is the expected value1 for the number of prior convictions?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(0*(128/(128+434+160+64+24)))+(1*(434/(128+434+160+64+24)))+(2*(160/(128+434+160+64+24)))+(3*(64/(128+434+160+64+24)))+(4*(24/(128+434+160+64+24)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.28642\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### f) Calculate the variance and the standard deviation for the Prior Convictions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvar(convictionsfreq$convictions)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2.5\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(convictionsfreq$convictions)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1.581139\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
