A particular home of 1240 square feet on a lot of 18,000 square feet sold for $145,000.\nFind the predicted selling price and the residual, and interpret.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nB. For fixed lot size, how much is the house selling price predicted to increase for each square-\nfoot increase in home size? Why?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nC. According to this prediction equation, for fixed home size, how much would lot size need\nto increase to have the same impact as a one-square-foot increase in home size?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n# Question 2\n(Data file: salary in alr4 R package). The data file concerns salary and other characteristics of all\nfaculty in a small Midwestern college collected in the early 1980s for presentation in legal\nproceedings for which discrimination against women in salary was at issue. All persons in the data\nhold tenured or tenure track positions; temporary faculty are not included. The variables include\ndegree, a factor with levels PhD and MS; rank, a factor with levels Asst, Assoc, and Prof; sex, a\nfactor with levels Male and Female; Year, years in current rank; ysdeg, years since highest degree,\nand salary, academic year salary in dollars.\n\nA. Test the hypothesis that the mean salary for men and women is the same, without regard to\nany other variable but sex. Explain your findings.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nB. Run a multiple linear regression with salary as the outcome variable and everything else as\npredictors, including sex. Assuming no interactions between sex and the other predictors,\nobtain a 95% confidence interval for the difference in salary between males and females.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nC. Interpret your finding for each predictor variable; discuss (a) statistical significance, (b)\ninterpretation of the coefficient / slope in relation to the outcome variable and other variables\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nD. Change the baseline category for the rank variable. Interpret the coefficients related to rank\nagain.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nE. Finkelstein (1980), in a discussion of the use of regression in discrimination cases, wrote,\n“[a] variable may reflect a position or status bestowed by the employer, in which case if there\nis discrimination in the award of the position or status, the variable may be ‘tainted.’ ” Thus,\nfor example, if discrimination is at work in promotion of faculty to higher ranks, using rank to\nadjust salaries before comparing the sexes may not be acceptable to the courts.\nExclude the variable rank, refit, and summarize how your findings changed, if they did.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nF. Everyone in this dataset was hired the year they earned their highest degree. It is also\nknown that a new Dean was appointed 15 years ago, and everyone in the dataset who\nearned their highest degree 15 years ago or less than that has been hired by the new Dean.\nSome people have argued that the new Dean has been making offers that are a lot more\ngenerous to newly hired faculty than the previous one and that this might explain some of\nthe variation in Salary.\nCreate a new variable that would allow you to test this hypothesis and run another multiple\nregression model to test this. Select variables carefully to make sure there is no\nmulticollinearity. Explain why multicollinearity would be a concern in this case and how\nyou avoided it. Do you find support for the hypothesis that the people hired by the new\nDean are making higher than those that were not?\n# Question 3\n(Data file: house.selling.price in smss R package)\n\nA. Using the house.selling.price data, run and report regression results modeling y = selling\nprice (in dollars) in terms of size of home (in square feet) and whether the home is new (1 =\nyes; 0 = no). In particular, for each variable; discuss statistical significance and interpret the\nmeaning of the coefficient.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nB. Report and interpret the prediction equation, and form separate equations relating selling\nprice to size for new and for not new homes.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nC. Find the predicted selling price for a home of 3000 square feet that is (i) new, (ii) not new.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nD. Fit another model, this time with an interaction term allowing interaction between size and\nnew, and report the regression results\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nE. Report the lines relating the predicted selling price to the size for homes that are (i) new,\n(ii) not new.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nF. Find the predicted selling price for a home of 3000 square feet that is (i) new, (ii) not new.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nG. Find the predicted selling price for a home of 1500 square feet that is (i) new, (ii) not new.\nComparing to (F), explain how the difference in predicted selling prices changes as the size\nof home increases.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nH. Do you think the model with interaction or the one without it represents the relationship of\nsize and new to the outcome price? What makes you prefer one model over another?\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::",
