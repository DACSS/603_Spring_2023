The relationship is negative which means as the log of GDP increase, there is a decrease in the log of Fertility.\n\nQuestion 2:\na.\nThe conversion results in dividing the USD value by 1.33 which means the slope also will become divided by 1.33\n\nb.\nThe correlation will not change as the unit of measurement change because it is a standardized measure. All the values will change in the same amount.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"water\")\npairs(water)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Jerin_Jacob_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYear appears to be largely unrelated to each of the other variables.\nThe three variables starting with “O” seem to be correlated with each other, meaning that all the plot including two of these variables exhibit a dependence between the variables that is stronger than the dependence between the “O” variables and other variables. The three variables starting with “A” also seem to be another correlated group.\nBSAAM is more closely related to the “O” variables than the “A” variables.\n\nQuestion 4:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"Rateprof\")\npairs(Rateprof[,c('quality', 'clarity', 'helpfulness', 'easiness', 'raterInterest')])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Jerin_Jacob_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nQuality, Clarity and Helpfulness seems to have a strong correlation between them. Easiness is fairly correlated with the other three variables. raterInterest is also moderately correlated but the raters say that they almost always have fairly good interest in the subject. Overall, it means that professors doing well in on of these variables are doing pretty well in others too.\n\nQuestion 5:\na.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(student.survey)\nggplot(data = student.survey, aes(x = re, fill = pi)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Jerin_Jacob_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = student.survey, aes(x = tv, y = hi)) +\n  geom_point() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Jerin_Jacob_HW3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nb.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel1 <- lm(as.numeric(pi) ~ as.numeric(re),\n             data = student.survey)\n\nmodel2 <- lm(hi ~ tv, ,data = student.survey)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstargazer(model1, model2, type = 'text', \n          dep.var.labels = c('Pol.
